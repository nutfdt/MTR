I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure\r\nmy dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success\r\nof my undertaking.\r\n\r\nI am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of\r\nPetersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which\r\nbraces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this\r\nfeeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards\r\nwhich I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.\r\nInspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent\r\nand vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of\r\nfrost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the\r\nregion of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever\r\nvisible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a\r\nperpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put\r\nsome trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished;\r\nand, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in\r\nwonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable\r\nglobe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the\r\nphenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered\r\nsolitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I\r\nmay there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may\r\nregulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this\r\nvoyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I\r\nshall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world\r\nnever before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by\r\nthe foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to\r\nconquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this\r\nlaborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little\r\nboat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his\r\nnative river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you\r\ncannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all\r\nmankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole\r\nto those countries, to reach which at present so many months are\r\nrequisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at\r\nall possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.\r\n\r\nThese reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my\r\nletter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me\r\nto heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as\r\na steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual\r\neye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I\r\nhave read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have\r\nbeen made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean\r\nthrough the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that a\r\nhistory of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the\r\nwhole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library. My education was neglected,\r\nyet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study\r\nday and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which\r\nI had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunction\r\nhad forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.\r\n\r\nThese visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets\r\nwhose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also\r\nbecame a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;\r\nI imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the\r\nnames of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well\r\nacquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.\r\nBut just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my\r\nthoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.\r\n\r\nSix years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I\r\ncan, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this\r\ngreat enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I\r\naccompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea;\r\nI voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often\r\nworked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my\r\nnights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those\r\nbranches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive\r\nthe greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an\r\nunder-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I\r\nmust own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second\r\ndignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest\r\nearnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.\r\n\r\nAnd now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?\r\nMy life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to\r\nevery enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging\r\nvoice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is\r\nfirm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am\r\nabout to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which\r\nwill demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits\r\nof others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.\r\n\r\nThis is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly\r\nquickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in\r\nmy opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach. The\r\ncold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which I have\r\nalready adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the\r\ndeck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise\r\nprevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. I have no\r\nambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and\r\nArchangel.\r\n\r\nI shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my\r\nintention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the\r\ninsurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary\r\namong those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to\r\nsail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how\r\ncan I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years,\r\nwill pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon,\r\nor never.\r\n\r\nFarewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you,\r\nand save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your\r\nlove and kindness.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate brother,\r\n\r\nR. Walton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter 2\r\n\r\n_To Mrs. Saville, England._\r\n\r\nArchangel, 28th March, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!\r\nYet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a\r\nvessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have\r\nalready engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly\r\npossessed of dauntless courage.\r\n\r\nBut I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the\r\nabsence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no\r\nfriend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there\r\nwill be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no\r\none will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts\r\nto paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of\r\nfeeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose\r\neyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I\r\nbitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet\r\ncourageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose\r\ntastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a\r\nfriend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution\r\nand too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me\r\nthat I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild\r\non a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas’ books of voyages.\r\nAt that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own\r\ncountry; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its\r\nmost important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the\r\nnecessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native\r\ncountry. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many\r\nschoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my\r\ndaydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters\r\ncall it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have sense\r\nenough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to\r\nendeavour to regulate my mind.\r\n\r\nWell, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the\r\nwide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet\r\nsome feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these\r\nrugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage\r\nand enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase\r\nmore characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an\r\nEnglishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices,\r\nunsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of\r\nhumanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel;\r\nfinding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist\r\nin my enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the\r\nship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This\r\ncircumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made\r\nme very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years\r\nspent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the\r\ngroundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to\r\nthe usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be\r\nnecessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness\r\nof heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt\r\nmyself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard\r\nof him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the\r\nhappiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved\r\na young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable\r\nsum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw\r\nhis mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in\r\ntears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,\r\nconfessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor,\r\nand that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend\r\nreassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover,\r\ninstantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his\r\nmoney, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he\r\nbestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his\r\nprize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young\r\nwoman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old\r\nman decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who,\r\nwhen he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned\r\nuntil he heard that his former mistress was married according to her\r\ninclinations. “What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim. He is\r\nso; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind\r\nof ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct\r\nthe more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which\r\notherwise he would command.\r\n\r\nYet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can\r\nconceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am\r\nwavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage\r\nis only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The\r\nwinter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it\r\nis considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail\r\nsooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly: you know me\r\nsufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the\r\nsafety of others is committed to my care.\r\n\r\nI cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my\r\nundertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of\r\nthe trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which\r\nI am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to “the\r\nland of mist and snow,” but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not\r\nbe alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and\r\nwoeful as the “Ancient Mariner.” You will smile at my allusion, but I\r\nwill disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my\r\npassionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that\r\nproduction of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something\r\nat work in my soul which I do not understand. I am practically\r\nindustrious—painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and\r\nlabour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief\r\nin the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out\r\nof the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited\r\nregions I am about to explore.\r\n\r\nBut to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after\r\nhaving traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of\r\nAfrica or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to\r\nlook on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to\r\nme by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when\r\nI need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly. \r\nRemember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate brother,\r\n Robert Walton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter 3\r\n\r\n_To Mrs. Saville, England._\r\n\r\nJuly 7th, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Sister,\r\n\r\nI write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe—and well advanced\r\non my voyage. This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on\r\nits homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not\r\nsee my native land, perhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good\r\nspirits: my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the\r\nfloating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers\r\nof the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We\r\nhave already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of\r\nsummer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales,\r\nwhich blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire\r\nto attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nNo incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a\r\nletter. One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are\r\naccidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and\r\nI shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured that for my own sake, as well as\r\nyours, I will not rashly encounter danger. I will be cool,\r\npersevering, and prudent.\r\n\r\nBut success _shall_ crown my endeavours. Wherefore not? Thus far I\r\nhave gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars\r\nthemselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph. Why not\r\nstill proceed over the untamed yet obedient element? What can stop the\r\ndetermined heart and resolved will of man?\r\n\r\nMy swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus. But I must\r\nfinish. Heaven bless my beloved sister!\r\n\r\nR.W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter 4\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Mrs. Saville, England._\r\n\r\nAugust 5th, 17—.\r\n\r\nSo strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear\r\nrecording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before\r\nthese papers can come into your possession.\r\n\r\nLast Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed\r\nin the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which\r\nshe floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we\r\nwere compassed round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to,\r\nhoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.\r\n\r\nAbout two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out\r\nin every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to\r\nhave no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to\r\ngrow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly\r\nattracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own\r\nsituation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by\r\ndogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a\r\nbeing which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,\r\nsat in the sledge and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress\r\nof the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the\r\ndistant inequalities of the ice.\r\n\r\nThis appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed,\r\nmany hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that\r\nit was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by\r\nice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the\r\ngreatest attention.\r\n\r\nAbout two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before\r\nnight the ice broke and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the\r\nmorning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which\r\nfloat about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to\r\nrest for a few hours.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and\r\nfound all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently\r\ntalking to someone in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we\r\nhad seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large\r\nfragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human\r\nbeing within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.\r\nHe was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of\r\nsome undiscovered island, but a European. When I appeared on deck the\r\nmaster said, “Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish\r\non the open sea.”\r\n\r\nOn perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a\r\nforeign accent. “Before I come on board your vessel,” said he,\r\n“will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?”\r\n\r\nYou may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed\r\nto me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have\r\nsupposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not\r\nhave exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I\r\nreplied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the\r\nnorthern pole.\r\n\r\nUpon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.\r\nGood God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for\r\nhis safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were\r\nnearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and\r\nsuffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted\r\nto carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh\r\nair he fainted. We accordingly brought him back to the deck and\r\nrestored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to\r\nswallow a small quantity. As soon as he showed signs of life we\r\nwrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the\r\nkitchen stove. By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,\r\nwhich restored him wonderfully.\r\n\r\nTwo days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often\r\nfeared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he\r\nhad in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and\r\nattended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never saw a more\r\ninteresting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of\r\nwildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone\r\nperforms an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most\r\ntrifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with\r\na beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he\r\nis generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his\r\nteeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.\r\n\r\nWhen my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off\r\nthe men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not\r\nallow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body\r\nand mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.\r\nOnce, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice\r\nin so strange a vehicle.\r\n\r\nHis countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and\r\nhe replied, “To seek one who fled from me.”\r\n\r\n“And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we\r\nsaw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”\r\n\r\nThis aroused the stranger’s attention, and he asked a multitude of\r\nquestions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had\r\npursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, “I have,\r\ndoubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good\r\npeople; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to\r\ntrouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.”\r\n\r\n“And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have\r\nbenevolently restored me to life.”\r\n\r\nSoon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the\r\nice had destroyed the other sledge. I replied that I could not answer\r\nwith any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near\r\nmidnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety\r\nbefore that time; but of this I could not judge.\r\n\r\nFrom this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the\r\nstranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for\r\nthe sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in\r\nthe cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.\r\nI have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant\r\nnotice if any new object should appear in sight.\r\n\r\nSuch is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the\r\npresent day. The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very\r\nsilent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.\r\nYet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all\r\ninterested in him, although they have had very little communication\r\nwith him. For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his\r\nconstant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. He must\r\nhave been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck\r\nso attractive and amiable.\r\n\r\nI said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend\r\non the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been\r\nbroken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother\r\nof my heart.\r\n\r\nI shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals,\r\nshould I have any fresh incidents to record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 13th, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my\r\nadmiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so\r\nnoble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant\r\ngrief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and\r\nwhen he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art,\r\nyet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.\r\n\r\nHe is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck,\r\napparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although\r\nunhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he\r\ninterests himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently\r\nconversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without\r\ndisguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my\r\neventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken\r\nto secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the\r\nlanguage of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul\r\nand to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would\r\nsacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my\r\nenterprise. One man’s life or death were but a small price to pay for\r\nthe acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should\r\nacquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a\r\ndark gloom spread over my listener’s countenance. At first I\r\nperceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before\r\nhis eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle\r\nfast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. I\r\npaused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: “Unhappy man! Do you\r\nshare my madness? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me;\r\nlet me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!”\r\n\r\nSuch words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the\r\nparoxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened\r\npowers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were\r\nnecessary to restore his composure.\r\n\r\nHaving conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise\r\nhimself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of\r\ndespair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. He asked\r\nme the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told, but it\r\nawakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a\r\nfriend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than\r\nhad ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could\r\nboast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.\r\n\r\n“I agree with you,” replied the stranger; “we are\r\nunfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than\r\nourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend his aid to\r\nperfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once had a friend, the most\r\nnoble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting\r\nfriendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for\r\ndespair. But I—I have lost everything and cannot begin life\r\nanew.”\r\n\r\nAs he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled\r\ngrief that touched me to the heart. But he was silent and presently\r\nretired to his cabin.\r\n\r\nEven broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he\r\ndoes the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight\r\nafforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of\r\nelevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double existence: he\r\nmay suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he\r\nhas retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a\r\nhalo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.\r\n\r\nWill you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine\r\nwanderer? You would not if you saw him. You have been tutored and\r\nrefined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore\r\nsomewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to\r\nappreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man. Sometimes I\r\nhave endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that\r\nelevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew. I\r\nbelieve it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing\r\npower of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled\r\nfor clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and a\r\nvoice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 19th, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\nYesterday the stranger said to me, “You may easily perceive, Captain\r\nWalton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had\r\ndetermined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with\r\nme, but you have won me to alter my determination. You seek for\r\nknowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the\r\ngratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine\r\nhas been. I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be\r\nuseful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same\r\ncourse, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me\r\nwhat I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one\r\nthat may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you\r\nin case of failure. Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually\r\ndeemed marvellous. Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might\r\nfear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things\r\nwill appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would\r\nprovoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers\r\nof nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series\r\ninternal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.”\r\n\r\nYou may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered\r\ncommunication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by\r\na recital of his misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear\r\nthe promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong\r\ndesire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power. I expressed\r\nthese feelings in my answer.\r\n\r\n“I thank you,” he replied, “for your sympathy, but it is\r\nuseless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I\r\nshall repose in peace. I understand your feeling,” continued he,\r\nperceiving that I wished to interrupt him; “but you are mistaken, my\r\nfriend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my\r\ndestiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is\r\ndetermined.”\r\n\r\nHe then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I\r\nshould be at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have\r\nresolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to\r\nrecord, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during\r\nthe day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes. This\r\nmanuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who\r\nknow him, and who hear it from his own lips—with what interest and\r\nsympathy shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as I commence my\r\ntask, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me\r\nwith all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in\r\nanimation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul\r\nwithin. Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which\r\nembraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it—thus!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 1\r\n\r\n\r\nI am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most\r\ndistinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years\r\ncounsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public\r\nsituations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who\r\nknew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public\r\nbusiness. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the\r\naffairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his\r\nmarrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a\r\nhusband and the father of a family.\r\n\r\nAs the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot\r\nrefrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a\r\nmerchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous\r\nmischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a\r\nproud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty\r\nand oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been\r\ndistinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts,\r\ntherefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his\r\ndaughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in\r\nwretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and\r\nwas deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.\r\nHe bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct\r\nso little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in\r\nendeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin\r\nthe world again through his credit and assistance.\r\n\r\nBeaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten\r\nmonths before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery,\r\nhe hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the\r\nReuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort\r\nhad saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but\r\nit was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in\r\nthe meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a\r\nmerchant’s house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction;\r\nhis grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for\r\nreflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end\r\nof three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.\r\n\r\nHis daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw\r\nwith despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that\r\nthere was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort\r\npossessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support\r\nher in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw and\r\nby various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to\r\nsupport life.\r\n\r\nSeveral months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time\r\nwas more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence\r\ndecreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving\r\nher an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt\r\nby Beaufort’s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the\r\nchamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who\r\ncommitted herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he\r\nconducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a\r\nrelation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.\r\n\r\nThere was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but\r\nthis circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted\r\naffection. There was a sense of justice in my father’s upright mind\r\nwhich rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love\r\nstrongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the\r\nlate-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set\r\na greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and\r\nworship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the\r\ndoting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her\r\nvirtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing\r\nher for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace\r\nto his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wishes\r\nand her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is\r\nsheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her\r\nwith all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and\r\nbenevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto\r\nconstant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During\r\nthe two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had\r\ngradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after\r\ntheir union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change\r\nof scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,\r\nas a restorative for her weakened frame.\r\n\r\nFrom Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born\r\nat Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained\r\nfor several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each\r\nother, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very\r\nmine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother’s tender caresses and\r\nmy father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my\r\nfirst recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something\r\nbetter—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on\r\nthem by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in\r\ntheir hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled\r\ntheir duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they owed\r\ntowards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit\r\nof tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during\r\nevery hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity,\r\nand of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but\r\none train of enjoyment to me.\r\n\r\nFor a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to have a\r\ndaughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five\r\nyears old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they\r\npassed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent\r\ndisposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. This, to my\r\nmother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a\r\npassion—remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been\r\nrelieved—for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the\r\nafflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale\r\nattracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number\r\nof half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst\r\nshape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother,\r\naccompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife,\r\nhard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to\r\nfive hungry babes. Among these there was one which attracted my mother far\r\nabove all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four others were\r\ndark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. Her\r\nhair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her\r\nclothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was\r\nclear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of\r\nher face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold\r\nher without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent,\r\nand bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.\r\n\r\nThe peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and\r\nadmiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was\r\nnot her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a\r\nGerman and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with\r\nthese good people to nurse: they were better off then. They had not been\r\nlong married, and their eldest child was but just born. The father of their\r\ncharge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory\r\nof Italy—one among the _schiavi ognor frementi,_ who exerted\r\nhimself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the victim of its\r\nweakness. Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria\r\nwas not known. His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and\r\na beggar. She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude\r\nabode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.\r\n\r\nWhen my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of\r\nour villa a child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemed\r\nto shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter\r\nthan the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his\r\npermission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their\r\ncharge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemed\r\na blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty\r\nand want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They\r\nconsulted their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza\r\nbecame the inmate of my parents’ house—my more than\r\nsister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and\r\nmy pleasures.\r\n\r\nEveryone loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential\r\nattachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my\r\npride and my delight. On the evening previous to her being brought to\r\nmy home, my mother had said playfully, “I have a pretty present for my\r\nVictor—tomorrow he shall have it.” And when, on the morrow, she\r\npresented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish\r\nseriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth\r\nas mine—mine to protect, love, and cherish. All praises bestowed on\r\nher I received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other\r\nfamiliarly by the name of cousin. No word, no expression could body\r\nforth the kind of relation in which she stood to me—my more than\r\nsister, since till death she was to be mine only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in\r\nour ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of\r\ndisunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and\r\nthe diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us\r\nnearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated\r\ndisposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense\r\napplication and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.\r\nShe busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets;\r\nand in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss\r\nhome —the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons,\r\ntempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of\r\nour Alpine summers—she found ample scope for admiration and delight.\r\nWhile my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the\r\nmagnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their\r\ncauses. The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.\r\nCuriosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature,\r\ngladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the\r\nearliest sensations I can remember.\r\n\r\nOn the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave\r\nup entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native\r\ncountry. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a _campagne_ on Belrive,\r\nthe eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a\r\nleague from the city. We resided principally in the latter, and the\r\nlives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my\r\ntemper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few. I was\r\nindifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united\r\nmyself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry\r\nClerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular\r\ntalent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for\r\nits own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. He\r\ncomposed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and\r\nknightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays and to enter into\r\nmasquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of\r\nRoncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous\r\ntrain who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands\r\nof the infidels.\r\n\r\nNo human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My\r\nparents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.\r\nWe felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to\r\ntheir caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights\r\nwhich we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families I distinctly\r\ndiscerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted\r\nthe development of filial love.\r\n\r\nMy temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some\r\nlaw in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits\r\nbut to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things\r\nindiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of languages,\r\nnor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states\r\npossessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth\r\nthat I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of\r\nthings or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man\r\nthat occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical,\r\nor in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral\r\nrelations of things. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes,\r\nand the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was\r\nto become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the\r\ngallant and adventurous benefactors of our species. The saintly soul\r\nof Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.\r\nHer sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of\r\nher celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was\r\nthe living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become\r\nsullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that\r\nshe was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. And\r\nClerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval? Yet\r\nhe might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his\r\ngenerosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for\r\nadventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of\r\nbeneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring\r\nambition.\r\n\r\nI feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood,\r\nbefore misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of\r\nextensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. Besides,\r\nin drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which\r\nled, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would\r\naccount to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my\r\ndestiny I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost\r\nforgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent\r\nwhich, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.\r\n\r\nNatural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire,\r\ntherefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my\r\npredilection for that science. When I was thirteen years of age we all went\r\non a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the\r\nweather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I\r\nchanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it\r\nwith apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful\r\nfacts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. A new\r\nlight seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my\r\ndiscovery to my father. My father looked carelessly at the title page of my\r\nbook and said, “Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do not waste\r\nyour time upon this; it is sad trash.”\r\n\r\nIf, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me\r\nthat the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern\r\nsystem of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers\r\nthan the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while\r\nthose of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances I\r\nshould certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my\r\nimagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my\r\nformer studies. It is even possible that the train of my ideas would never\r\nhave received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin. But the cursory glance\r\nmy father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was\r\nacquainted with its contents, and I continued to read with the greatest\r\navidity.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this\r\nauthor, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and\r\nstudied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me\r\ntreasures known to few besides myself. I have described myself as always\r\nhaving been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of\r\nnature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern\r\nphilosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied.\r\nSir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking\r\nup shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his\r\nsuccessors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted\r\nappeared even to my boy’s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same\r\npursuit.\r\n\r\nThe untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted\r\nwith their practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little\r\nmore. He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal\r\nlineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He might dissect,\r\nanatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes\r\nin their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him. I\r\nhad gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep\r\nhuman beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and\r\nignorantly I had repined.\r\n\r\nBut here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew\r\nmore. I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their\r\ndisciple. It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth\r\ncentury; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of\r\nGeneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite\r\nstudies. My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a\r\nchild’s blindness, added to a student’s thirst for knowledge.\r\nUnder the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest\r\ndiligence into the search of the philosopher’s stone and the elixir\r\nof life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention. Wealth was an\r\ninferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could\r\nbanish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but\r\na violent death!\r\n\r\nNor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a\r\npromise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which\r\nI most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I\r\nattributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a\r\nwant of skill or fidelity in my instructors. And thus for a time I was\r\noccupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand\r\ncontradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of\r\nmultifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish\r\nreasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas.\r\n\r\nWhen I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near\r\nBelrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm. It\r\nadvanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once\r\nwith frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained,\r\nwhile the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight.\r\nAs I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an\r\nold and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so\r\nsoon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing\r\nremained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next morning, we found\r\nthe tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by the\r\nshock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood. I never beheld\r\nanything so utterly destroyed.\r\n\r\nBefore this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of\r\nelectricity. On this occasion a man of great research in natural\r\nphilosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on\r\nthe explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of\r\nelectricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.\r\nAll that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa,\r\nAlbertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by\r\nsome fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my\r\naccustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever\r\nbe known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew\r\ndespicable. By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps\r\nmost subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former\r\noccupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed\r\nand abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a\r\nwould-be science which could never even step within the threshold of\r\nreal knowledge. In this mood of mind I betook myself to the\r\nmathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as\r\nbeing built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.\r\n\r\nThus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments\r\nare we bound to prosperity or ruin. When I look back, it seems to me\r\nas if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the\r\nimmediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life—the last effort\r\nmade by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even\r\nthen hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me. Her victory was\r\nannounced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which\r\nfollowed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting\r\nstudies. It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with\r\ntheir prosecution, happiness with their disregard.\r\n\r\nIt was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual.\r\nDestiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and\r\nterrible destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 3\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I\r\nshould become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I had\r\nhitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it\r\nnecessary for the completion of my education that I should be made\r\nacquainted with other customs than those of my native country. My\r\ndeparture was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day\r\nresolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life\r\noccurred—an omen, as it were, of my future misery.\r\n\r\nElizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was\r\nin the greatest danger. During her illness many arguments had been urged to\r\npersuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had at first\r\nyielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her\r\nfavourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She\r\nattended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity\r\nof the distemper—Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this\r\nimprudence were fatal to her preserver. On the third day my mother\r\nsickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the\r\nlooks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her\r\ndeathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert\r\nher. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself. “My\r\nchildren,” she said, “my firmest hopes of future happiness were\r\nplaced on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the\r\nconsolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to\r\nmy younger children. Alas! I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy\r\nand beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? But these are\r\nnot thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to\r\ndeath and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.”\r\n\r\nShe died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death.\r\nI need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent\r\nby that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the\r\nsoul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. It is so\r\nlong before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day\r\nand whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed\r\nfor ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been\r\nextinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear\r\ncan be hushed, never more to be heard. These are the reflections of\r\nthe first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the\r\nevil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom has\r\nnot that rude hand rent away some dear connection? And why should I\r\ndescribe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time at\r\nlength arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and\r\nthe smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a\r\nsacrilege, is not banished. My mother was dead, but we had still\r\nduties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the\r\nrest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the\r\nspoiler has not seized.\r\n\r\nMy departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events,\r\nwas now again determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite of\r\nsome weeks. It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose,\r\nakin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of\r\nlife. I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. I was\r\nunwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above\r\nall, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.\r\n\r\nShe indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all.\r\nShe looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and\r\nzeal. She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call\r\nher uncle and cousins. Never was she so enchanting as at this time,\r\nwhen she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us.\r\nShe forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.\r\n\r\nThe day of my departure at length arrived. Clerval spent the last\r\nevening with us. He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit\r\nhim to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain. His\r\nfather was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the\r\naspirations and ambition of his son. Henry deeply felt the misfortune\r\nof being debarred from a liberal education. He said little, but when\r\nhe spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a\r\nrestrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details\r\nof commerce.\r\n\r\nWe sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor\r\npersuade ourselves to say the word “Farewell!” It was said, and we\r\nretired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the\r\nother was deceived; but when at morning’s dawn I descended to the\r\ncarriage which was to convey me away, they were all there—my father\r\nagain to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to\r\nrenew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last\r\nfeminine attentions on her playmate and friend.\r\n\r\nI threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in\r\nthe most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by\r\namiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual\r\npleasure—I was now alone. In the university whither I was going I\r\nmust form my own friends and be my own protector. My life had hitherto\r\nbeen remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible\r\nrepugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and\r\nClerval; these were “old familiar faces,” but I believed myself\r\ntotally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as\r\nI commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I\r\nardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home,\r\nthought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had\r\nlonged to enter the world and take my station among other human beings. \r\nNow my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to\r\nrepent.\r\n\r\nI had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my\r\njourney to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the\r\nhigh white steeple of the town met my eyes. I alighted and was\r\nconducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to\r\nsome of the principal professors. Chance—or rather the evil\r\ninfluence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me\r\nfrom the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father’s\r\ndoor—led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. He\r\nwas an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. He\r\nasked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches\r\nof science appertaining to natural philosophy. I replied carelessly, and\r\npartly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal\r\nauthors I had studied. The professor stared. “Have you,” he\r\nsaid, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense?”\r\n\r\nI replied in the affirmative. “Every minute,” continued M. Krempe with\r\nwarmth, “every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly\r\nand entirely lost. You have burdened your memory with exploded systems\r\nand useless names. Good God! In what desert land have you lived,\r\nwhere no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you\r\nhave so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they\r\nare ancient? I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific\r\nage, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear\r\nsir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books\r\ntreating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and\r\ndismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following\r\nweek he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural\r\nphilosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow\r\nprofessor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he\r\nomitted.\r\n\r\nI returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long\r\nconsidered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I\r\nreturned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any\r\nshape. M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a\r\nrepulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in\r\nfavour of his pursuits. In rather a too philosophical and connected a\r\nstrain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come\r\nto concerning them in my early years. As a child I had not been\r\ncontent with the results promised by the modern professors of natural\r\nscience. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my\r\nextreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the\r\nsteps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the\r\ndiscoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.\r\nBesides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.\r\nIt was very different when the masters of the science sought\r\nimmortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now\r\nthe scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit\r\nitself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in\r\nscience was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of\r\nboundless grandeur for realities of little worth.\r\n\r\nSuch were my reflections during the first two or three days of my\r\nresidence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming\r\nacquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new\r\nabode. But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information\r\nwhich M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And although I\r\ncould not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver\r\nsentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M.\r\nWaldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.\r\n\r\nPartly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing\r\nroom, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very\r\nunlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an\r\naspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his\r\ntemples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His person\r\nwas short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.\r\nHe began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and\r\nthe various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing\r\nwith fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took\r\na cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of\r\nits elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments, he\r\nconcluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I\r\nshall never forget:\r\n\r\n“The ancient teachers of this science,” said he,\r\n“promised impossibilities and performed nothing. The modern masters\r\npromise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that\r\nthe elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem\r\nonly made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or\r\ncrucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses\r\nof nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. They ascend into the\r\nheavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of\r\nthe air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers;\r\nthey can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even\r\nmock the invisible world with its own shadows.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words of\r\nthe fate—enounced to destroy me. As he went on I felt as if my soul\r\nwere grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were\r\ntouched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was\r\nsounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,\r\none purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of\r\nFrankenstein—more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps\r\nalready marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and\r\nunfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.\r\n\r\nI closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of\r\ninsurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I\r\nhad no power to produce it. By degrees, after the morning’s dawn,\r\nsleep came. I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream.\r\nThere only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to\r\ndevote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a\r\nnatural talent. On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit. His\r\nmanners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public,\r\nfor there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in\r\nhis own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. I\r\ngave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had\r\ngiven to his fellow professor. He heard with attention the little\r\nnarration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius\r\nAgrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had\r\nexhibited. He said that “These were men to whose indefatigable zeal\r\nmodern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their\r\nknowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names\r\nand arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a\r\ngreat degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The\r\nlabours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever\r\nfail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.” I\r\nlistened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption\r\nor affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my\r\nprejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured\r\nterms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his\r\ninstructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have\r\nmade me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended\r\nlabours. I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to\r\nprocure.\r\n\r\n“I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained a\r\ndisciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of\r\nyour success. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the\r\ngreatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that\r\nI have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not\r\nneglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry\r\nchemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your\r\nwish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty\r\nexperimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural\r\nphilosophy, including mathematics.”\r\n\r\nHe then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his\r\nvarious machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and\r\npromising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in\r\nthe science not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list of\r\nbooks which I had requested, and I took my leave.\r\n\r\nThus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 4\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the\r\nmost comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.\r\nI read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,\r\nwhich modern inquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the\r\nlectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the\r\nuniversity, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense\r\nand real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive\r\nphysiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In\r\nM. Waldman I found a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by\r\ndogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and\r\ngood nature that banished every idea of pedantry. In a thousand ways\r\nhe smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse\r\ninquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. My application was at\r\nfirst fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and\r\nsoon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the\r\nlight of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.\r\n\r\nAs I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress\r\nwas rapid. My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and\r\nmy proficiency that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me,\r\nwith a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman\r\nexpressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two years\r\npassed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was\r\nengaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I\r\nhoped to make. None but those who have experienced them can conceive\r\nof the enticements of science. In other studies you go as far as\r\nothers have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in\r\na scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.\r\nA mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must\r\ninfallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who\r\ncontinually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was\r\nsolely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two\r\nyears I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical\r\ninstruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the\r\nuniversity. When I had arrived at this point and had become as well\r\nacquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as\r\ndepended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my\r\nresidence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought\r\nof returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident\r\nhappened that protracted my stay.\r\n\r\nOne of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was\r\nthe structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with\r\nlife. Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?\r\nIt was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a\r\nmystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming\r\nacquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our\r\ninquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined\r\nthenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of\r\nnatural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had been\r\nanimated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this\r\nstudy would have been irksome and almost intolerable. To examine the\r\ncauses of life, we must first have recourse to death. I became\r\nacquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I\r\nmust also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.\r\nIn my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my\r\nmind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever\r\nremember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared\r\nthe apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and\r\na churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of\r\nlife, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become\r\nfood for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of\r\nthis decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and\r\ncharnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the most\r\ninsupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how the\r\nfine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of\r\ndeath succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm\r\ninherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused, examining and\r\nanalysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change\r\nfrom life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this\r\ndarkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and\r\nwondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity\r\nof the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so\r\nmany men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same\r\nscience, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a\r\nsecret.\r\n\r\nRemember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not\r\nmore certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is\r\ntrue. Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the\r\ndiscovery were distinct and probable. After days and nights of\r\nincredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of\r\ngeneration and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing\r\nanimation upon lifeless matter.\r\n\r\nThe astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery\r\nsoon gave place to delight and rapture. After so much time spent in\r\npainful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the\r\nmost gratifying consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so\r\ngreat and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been\r\nprogressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.\r\nWhat had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation\r\nof the world was now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it\r\nall opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a\r\nnature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them\r\ntowards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already\r\naccomplished. I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead\r\nand found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly\r\nineffectual light.\r\n\r\nI see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes\r\nexpress, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with\r\nwhich I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end\r\nof my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that\r\nsubject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was,\r\nto your destruction and infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my\r\nprecepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of\r\nknowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town\r\nto be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature\r\nwill allow.\r\n\r\nWhen I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated\r\na long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.\r\nAlthough I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to\r\nprepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of\r\nfibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable\r\ndifficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I should attempt the\r\ncreation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my\r\nimagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to\r\ndoubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful\r\nas man. The materials at present within my command hardly appeared\r\nadequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should\r\nultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my\r\noperations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be\r\nimperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes\r\nplace in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present\r\nattempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. Nor\r\ncould I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any\r\nargument of its impracticability. It was with these feelings that I\r\nbegan the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of the parts\r\nformed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first\r\nintention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say,\r\nabout eight feet in height, and proportionably large. After having\r\nformed this determination and having spent some months in successfully\r\ncollecting and arranging my materials, I began.\r\n\r\nNo one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like\r\na hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death\r\nappeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and\r\npour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless\r\nme as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would\r\nowe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his\r\nchild so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these\r\nreflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless\r\nmatter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible)\r\nrenew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking\r\nwith unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my\r\nperson had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very\r\nbrink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the\r\nnext day or the next hour might realise. One secret which I alone\r\npossessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon\r\ngazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless\r\neagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive\r\nthe horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps\r\nof the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless\r\nclay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but\r\nthen a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed\r\nto have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was\r\nindeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed\r\nacuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had\r\nreturned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel-houses and\r\ndisturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human\r\nframe. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,\r\nand separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,\r\nI kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from\r\ntheir sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The\r\ndissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials;\r\nand often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,\r\nwhilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I\r\nbrought my work near to a conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in\r\none pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields\r\nbestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant\r\nvintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. And the\r\nsame feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also\r\nto forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had\r\nnot seen for so long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them, and I\r\nwell remembered the words of my father: “I know that while you are\r\npleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall\r\nhear regularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard any\r\ninterruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties\r\nare equally neglected.”\r\n\r\nI knew well therefore what would be my father’s feelings, but I could\r\nnot tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which\r\nhad taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as it\r\nwere, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection\r\nuntil the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature,\r\nshould be completed.\r\n\r\nI then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect\r\nto vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was\r\njustified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from\r\nblame. A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and\r\npeaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to\r\ndisturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge\r\nis an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself\r\nhas a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for\r\nthose simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that\r\nstudy is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human\r\nmind. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit\r\nwhatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic\r\naffections, Greece had not been enslaved, Cæsar would have spared his\r\ncountry, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the\r\nempires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.\r\n\r\nBut I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my\r\ntale, and your looks remind me to proceed.\r\n\r\nMy father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my\r\nsilence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.\r\nWinter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not\r\nwatch the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which before always\r\nyielded me supreme delight—so deeply was I engrossed in my\r\noccupation. The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near\r\nto a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had\r\nsucceeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared\r\nrather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other\r\nunwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.\r\nEvery night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most\r\npainful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow\r\ncreatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed at\r\nthe wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone\r\nsustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and\r\namusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself\r\nboth of these when my creation should be complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 5\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment\r\nof my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I\r\ncollected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a\r\nspark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was\r\nalready one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the\r\npanes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the\r\nhalf-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature\r\nopen; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.\r\n\r\nHow can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate\r\nthe wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to\r\nform? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as\r\nbeautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered\r\nthe work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous\r\nblack, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these\r\nluxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes,\r\nthat seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which\r\nthey were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.\r\n\r\nThe different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings\r\nof human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole\r\npurpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had\r\ndeprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour\r\nthat far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty\r\nof the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my\r\nheart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I\r\nrushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my\r\nbed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude\r\nsucceeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the\r\nbed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.\r\nBut it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest\r\ndreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in\r\nthe streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her,\r\nbut as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with\r\nthe hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I\r\nheld the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her\r\nform, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.\r\nI started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my\r\nteeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and\r\nyellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window\r\nshutters, I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom I had\r\ncreated. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they\r\nmay be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some\r\ninarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have\r\nspoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to\r\ndetain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs. I took refuge in the\r\ncourtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained\r\nduring the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest\r\nagitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if\r\nit were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I\r\nhad so miserably given life.\r\n\r\nOh! No mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy\r\nagain endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I\r\nhad gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those\r\nmuscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing\r\nsuch as even Dante could not have conceived.\r\n\r\nI passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and\r\nhardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly\r\nsank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with\r\nthis horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had\r\nbeen my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a\r\nhell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!\r\n\r\nMorning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my\r\nsleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple\r\nand clock, which indicated the sixth hour. The porter opened the gates\r\nof the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into\r\nthe streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the\r\nwretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my\r\nview. I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but\r\nfelt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured\r\nfrom a black and comfortless sky.\r\n\r\nI continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by\r\nbodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I\r\ntraversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or\r\nwhat I was doing. My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I\r\nhurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:\r\n \r\n Like one who, on a lonely road,\r\n Doth walk in fear and dread,\r\n And, having once turned round, walks on,\r\n And turns no more his head;\r\n Because he knows a frightful fiend\r\n Doth close behind him tread.\r\n \r\n [Coleridge’s “Ancient Mariner.”]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContinuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various\r\ndiligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew not why;\r\nbut I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming\r\ntowards me from the other end of the street. As it drew nearer I observed\r\nthat it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and\r\non the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me,\r\ninstantly sprung out. “My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed he,\r\n“how glad I am to see you! How fortunate that you should be here at\r\nthe very moment of my alighting!”\r\n\r\nNothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back\r\nto my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear\r\nto my recollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror\r\nand misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months,\r\ncalm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial\r\nmanner, and we walked towards my college. Clerval continued talking for\r\nsome time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being\r\npermitted to come to Ingolstadt. “You may easily believe,” said\r\nhe, “how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all\r\nnecessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping;\r\nand, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant\r\nanswer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch\r\nschoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: ‘I have ten thousand florins\r\na year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.’ But his\r\naffection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has\r\npermitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of\r\nknowledge.”\r\n\r\n“It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left\r\nmy father, brothers, and Elizabeth.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from\r\nyou so seldom. By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their\r\naccount myself. But, my dear Frankenstein,” continued he, stopping\r\nshort and gazing full in my face, “I did not before remark how very ill\r\nyou appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for\r\nseveral nights.”\r\n\r\n“You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one\r\noccupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see;\r\nbut I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an\r\nend and that I am at length free.”\r\n\r\nI trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to\r\nallude to, the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with a\r\nquick pace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and\r\nthe thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my\r\napartment might still be there, alive and walking about. I dreaded to\r\nbehold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him.\r\nEntreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the\r\nstairs, I darted up towards my own room. My hand was already on the\r\nlock of the door before I recollected myself. I then paused, and a\r\ncold shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly open, as\r\nchildren are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in\r\nwaiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. I stepped\r\nfearfully in: the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed\r\nfrom its hideous guest. I could hardly believe that so great a good\r\nfortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy\r\nhad indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.\r\n\r\nWe ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast;\r\nbut I was unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed\r\nme; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse\r\nbeat rapidly. I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same\r\nplace; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.\r\nClerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival,\r\nbut when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes\r\nfor which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless\r\nlaughter frightened and astonished him.\r\n\r\n“My dear Victor,” cried he, “what, for God’s sake,\r\nis the matter? Do not laugh in that manner. How ill you are! What is the\r\ncause of all this?”\r\n\r\n“Do not ask me,” cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I\r\nthought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; “_he_ can\r\ntell. Oh, save me! Save me!” I imagined that the monster seized me;\r\nI struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.\r\n\r\nPoor Clerval! What must have been his feelings? A meeting, which he\r\nanticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. But I\r\nwas not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not\r\nrecover my senses for a long, long time.\r\n\r\nThis was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for\r\nseveral months. During all that time Henry was my only nurse. I\r\nafterwards learned that, knowing my father’s advanced age and unfitness\r\nfor so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make\r\nElizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my\r\ndisorder. He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive\r\nnurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he\r\ndid not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest\r\naction that he could towards them.\r\n\r\nBut I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and\r\nunremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.\r\nThe form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever\r\nbefore my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my\r\nwords surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings\r\nof my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I\r\ncontinually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder\r\nindeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.\r\n\r\nBy very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and\r\ngrieved my friend, I recovered. I remember the first time I became\r\ncapable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I\r\nperceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young\r\nbuds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. It was\r\na divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my\r\nconvalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in\r\nmy bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as\r\ncheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.\r\n\r\n“Dearest Clerval,” exclaimed I, “how kind, how very good\r\nyou are to me. This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you\r\npromised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I ever\r\nrepay you? I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I\r\nhave been the occasion, but you will forgive me.”\r\n\r\n“You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get\r\nwell as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I\r\nmay speak to you on one subject, may I not?”\r\n\r\nI trembled. One subject! What could it be? Could he allude to an object on\r\nwhom I dared not even think?\r\n\r\n“Compose yourself,” said Clerval, who observed my change of\r\ncolour, “I will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father\r\nand cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your\r\nown handwriting. They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at\r\nyour long silence.”\r\n\r\n“Is that all, my dear Henry? How could you suppose that my first\r\nthought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and\r\nwho are so deserving of my love?”\r\n\r\n“If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad\r\nto see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from\r\nyour cousin, I believe.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 6\r\n\r\n\r\nClerval then put the following letter into my hands. It was from my\r\nown Elizabeth:\r\n\r\n“My dearest Cousin,\r\n\r\n“You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant "

Therefore you must not, in every case at least,\r\n  take the higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in\r\n  these extracts, for veritable gospel cetology. Far from it.

For by how much the more\r\n  pains ye take to please the world, by so much the more shall ye for\r\n  ever go thankless! Would that I could clear out Hampton Court and the\r\n  Tuileries for ye!

Loomings.\r\n\r\nCall me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having\r\nlittle or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me\r\non shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part\r\nof the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and\r\nregulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about\r\nthe mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever\r\nI find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and\r\nbringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever\r\nmy hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral\r\nprinciple to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and\r\nmethodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to\r\nget to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball.\r\nWith a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I\r\nquietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they\r\nbut knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other,\r\ncherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.\r\n\r\nThere now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by\r\nwharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her\r\nsurf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme\r\ndowntown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and\r\ncooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of\r\nland. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.\r\n\r\nCircumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears\r\nHook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What\r\ndo you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand\r\nthousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some\r\nleaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some\r\nlooking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the\r\nrigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these\r\nare all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to\r\ncounters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are\r\nthe green fields gone? What do they here?\r\n\r\nBut look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and\r\nseemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the\r\nextremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder\r\nwarehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water\r\nas they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand—miles of\r\nthem—leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets\r\nand avenues—north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell\r\nme, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all\r\nthose ships attract them thither?\r\n\r\nOnce more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take\r\nalmost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a\r\ndale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in\r\nit. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest\r\nreveries—stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will\r\ninfallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region.\r\nShould you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this\r\nexperiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical\r\nprofessor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for\r\never.\r\n\r\nBut here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest,\r\nquietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley\r\nof the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his\r\ntrees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were\r\nwithin; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up\r\nfrom yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands\r\nwinds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in\r\ntheir hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and\r\nthough this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this\r\nshepherd’s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd’s eye were\r\nfixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June,\r\nwhen for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among\r\nTiger-lilies—what is the one charm wanting?—Water—there is not a drop\r\nof water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel\r\nyour thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon\r\nsuddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy\r\nhim a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian\r\ntrip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a\r\nrobust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea?\r\nWhy upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a\r\nmystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out\r\nof sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did\r\nthe Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely\r\nall this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that\r\nstory of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild\r\nimage he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that\r\nsame image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image\r\nof the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.\r\n\r\nNow, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin\r\nto grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my\r\nlungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a\r\npassenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a\r\npurse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers\r\nget sea-sick—grow quarrelsome—don’t sleep of nights—do not enjoy\r\nthemselves much, as a general thing;—no, I never go as a passenger;\r\nnor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a\r\nCommodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction\r\nof such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all\r\nhonorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind\r\nwhatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself,\r\nwithout taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not.\r\nAnd as for going as cook,—though I confess there is considerable glory\r\nin that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board—yet, somehow, I\r\nnever fancied broiling fowls;—though once broiled, judiciously\r\nbuttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who\r\nwill speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled\r\nfowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old\r\nEgyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the\r\nmummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.\r\n\r\nNo, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,\r\nplumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.\r\nTrue, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to\r\nspar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of\r\nthing is unpleasant enough. It touches one’s sense of honor,\r\nparticularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the\r\nVan Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if\r\njust previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been\r\nlording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in\r\nawe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a\r\nschoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and\r\nthe Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off\r\nin time.\r\n\r\nWhat of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom\r\nand sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed,\r\nI mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel\r\nGabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and\r\nrespectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain’t\r\na slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may\r\norder me about—however they may thump and punch me about, I have the\r\nsatisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is\r\none way or other served in much the same way—either in a physical or\r\nmetaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is\r\npassed round, and all hands should rub each other’s shoulder-blades,\r\nand be content.\r\n\r\nAgain, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of\r\npaying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single\r\npenny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must\r\npay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying and\r\nbeing paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable\r\ninfliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But _being\r\npaid_,—what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man\r\nreceives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly\r\nbelieve money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no\r\naccount can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign\r\nourselves to perdition!\r\n\r\nFinally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome\r\nexercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world,\r\nhead winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if\r\nyou never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the\r\nCommodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from\r\nthe sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not\r\nso. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many\r\nother things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But\r\nwherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a\r\nmerchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling\r\nvoyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the\r\nconstant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in\r\nsome unaccountable way—he can better answer than any one else. And,\r\ndoubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand\r\nprogramme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in\r\nas a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive\r\nperformances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run\r\nsomething like this:\r\n\r\n“_Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States._\r\n“WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. “BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.”\r\n\r\nThough I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the\r\nFates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when\r\nothers were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short\r\nand easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces—though I\r\ncannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the\r\ncircumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives\r\nwhich being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced\r\nme to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the\r\ndelusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill\r\nand discriminating judgment.\r\n\r\nChief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale\r\nhimself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my\r\ncuriosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island\r\nbulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all\r\nthe attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds,\r\nhelped to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things\r\nwould not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an\r\neverlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and\r\nland on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to\r\nperceive a horror, and could still be social with it—would they let\r\nme—since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of\r\nthe place one lodges in.\r\n\r\nBy reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the\r\ngreat flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild\r\nconceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into\r\nmy inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them\r\nall, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. The Carpet-Bag.\r\n\r\nI stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my\r\narm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city\r\nof old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night\r\nin December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little\r\npacket for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching\r\nthat place would offer, till the following Monday.\r\n\r\nAs most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at\r\nthis same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well\r\nbe related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was\r\nmade up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a\r\nfine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous\r\nold island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has\r\nof late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though\r\nin this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket\r\nwas her great original—the Tyre of this Carthage;—the place where the\r\nfirst dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket\r\ndid those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes\r\nto give chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did\r\nthat first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with\r\nimported cobblestones—so goes the story—to throw at the whales, in\r\norder to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the\r\nbowsprit?\r\n\r\nNow having a night, a day, and still another night following before me\r\nin New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a\r\nmatter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a\r\nvery dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold\r\nand cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had\r\nsounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,—So,\r\nwherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of\r\na dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the\r\nnorth with the darkness towards the south—wherever in your wisdom you\r\nmay conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to\r\ninquire the price, and don’t be too particular.\r\n\r\nWith halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of “The\r\nCrossed Harpoons”—but it looked too expensive and jolly there. Further\r\non, from the bright red windows of the “Sword-Fish Inn,” there came\r\nsuch fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and\r\nice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay\r\nten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,—rather weary for me,\r\nwhen I struck my foot against the flinty projections, because from\r\nhard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most\r\nmiserable plight. Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one\r\nmoment to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of\r\nthe tinkling glasses within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don’t\r\nyou hear? get away from before the door; your patched boots are\r\nstopping the way. So on I went. I now by instinct followed the streets\r\nthat took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not\r\nthe cheeriest inns.\r\n\r\nSuch dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand,\r\nand here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At\r\nthis hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of\r\nthe town proved all but deserted. But presently I came to a smoky light\r\nproceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood\r\ninvitingly open. It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the\r\nuses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was to stumble\r\nover an ash-box in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying\r\nparticles almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city,\r\nGomorrah? But “The Crossed Harpoons,” and “The Sword-Fish?”—this, then\r\nmust needs be the sign of “The Trap.” However, I picked myself up and\r\nhearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second, interior\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nIt seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black\r\nfaces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of\r\nDoom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the\r\npreacher’s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping\r\nand wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing\r\nout, Wretched entertainment at the sign of ‘The Trap!’\r\n\r\nMoving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the\r\ndocks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a\r\nswinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly\r\nrepresenting a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words\r\nunderneath—“The Spouter Inn:—Peter Coffin.”\r\n\r\nCoffin?—Spouter?—Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought\r\nI. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this\r\nPeter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and\r\nthe place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated\r\nlittle wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here\r\nfrom the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a\r\npoverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very\r\nspot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.\r\n\r\nIt was a queer sort of place—a gable-ended old house, one side palsied\r\nas it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner,\r\nwhere that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than\r\never it did about poor Paul’s tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless,\r\nis a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the\r\nhob quietly toasting for bed. “In judging of that tempestuous wind\r\ncalled Euroclydon,” says an old writer—of whose works I possess the\r\nonly copy extant—“it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou\r\nlookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the\r\noutside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where\r\nthe frost is on both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only\r\nglazier.” True enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my\r\nmind—old black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are\r\nwindows, and this body of mine is the house. What a pity they didn’t\r\nstop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint\r\nhere and there. But it’s too late to make any improvements now. The\r\nuniverse is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted\r\noff a million years ago. Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth\r\nagainst the curbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with\r\nhis shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags, and put a\r\ncorn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out the\r\ntempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his red silken\r\nwrapper—(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What a fine frosty\r\nnight; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them talk of their\r\noriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the\r\nprivilege of making my own summer with my own coals.\r\n\r\nBut what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up\r\nto the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra\r\nthan here? Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the\r\nline of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in\r\norder to keep out this frost?\r\n\r\nNow, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the\r\ndoor of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be\r\nmoored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a\r\nCzar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a\r\ntemperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.\r\n\r\nBut no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there\r\nis plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frosted\r\nfeet, and see what sort of a place this “Spouter” may be.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. The Spouter-Inn.\r\n\r\nEntering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,\r\nlow, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of\r\nthe bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large\r\noilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the\r\nunequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent\r\nstudy and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of\r\nthe neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its\r\npurpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first\r\nyou almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New\r\nEngland hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint\r\nof much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and\r\nespecially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the\r\nentry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however\r\nwild, might not be altogether unwarranted.\r\n\r\nBut what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber,\r\nportentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the\r\npicture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a\r\nnameless yeast. A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive\r\na nervous man distracted. Yet was there a sort of indefinite,\r\nhalf-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to\r\nit, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what\r\nthat marvellous painting meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas,\r\ndeceptive idea would dart you through.—It’s the Black Sea in a midnight\r\ngale.—It’s the unnatural combat of the four primal elements.—It’s a\r\nblasted heath.—It’s a Hyperborean winter scene.—It’s the breaking-up of\r\nthe icebound stream of Time. But at last all these fancies yielded to\r\nthat one portentous something in the picture’s midst. _That_ once found\r\nout, and all the rest were plain. But stop; does it not bear a faint\r\nresemblance to a gigantic fish? even the great leviathan himself?\r\n\r\nIn fact, the artist’s design seemed this: a final theory of my own,\r\npartly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with\r\nwhom I conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner\r\nin a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its\r\nthree dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale,\r\npurposing to spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of\r\nimpaling himself upon the three mast-heads.\r\n\r\nThe opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish\r\narray of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with\r\nglittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots\r\nof human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping\r\nround like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed\r\nmower. You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal\r\nand savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking,\r\nhorrifying implement. Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances\r\nand harpoons all broken and deformed. Some were storied weapons. With\r\nthis once long lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan\r\nSwain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that\r\nharpoon—so like a corkscrew now—was flung in Javan seas, and run away\r\nwith by a whale, years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco. The\r\noriginal iron entered nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle\r\nsojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty feet, and at last\r\nwas found imbedded in the hump.\r\n\r\nCrossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way—cut\r\nthrough what in old times must have been a great central chimney with\r\nfireplaces all round—you enter the public room. A still duskier place\r\nis this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled\r\nplanks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft’s\r\ncockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored\r\nold ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like\r\ntable covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities\r\ngathered from this wide world’s remotest nooks. Projecting from the\r\nfurther angle of the room stands a dark-looking den—the bar—a rude\r\nattempt at a right whale’s head. Be that how it may, there stands the\r\nvast arched bone of the whale’s jaw, so wide, a coach might almost\r\ndrive beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old\r\ndecanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction,\r\nlike another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him),\r\nbustles a little withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells\r\nthe sailors deliriums and death.\r\n\r\nAbominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though true\r\ncylinders without—within, the villanous green goggling glasses\r\ndeceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians\r\nrudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads’ goblets. Fill to\r\n_this_ mark, and your charge is but a penny; to _this_ a penny more;\r\nand so on to the full glass—the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp\r\ndown for a shilling.\r\n\r\nUpon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about\r\na table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of _skrimshander_. I\r\nsought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with\r\na room, received for answer that his house was full—not a bed\r\nunoccupied. “But avast,” he added, tapping his forehead, “you haint no\r\nobjections to sharing a harpooneer’s blanket, have ye? I s’pose you are\r\ngoin’ a-whalin’, so you’d better get used to that sort of thing.”\r\n\r\nI told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should\r\never do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and that\r\nif he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the\r\nharpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander\r\nfurther about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with\r\nthe half of any decent man’s blanket.\r\n\r\n“I thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?—you want supper?\r\nSupper’ll be ready directly.”\r\n\r\nI sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the\r\nBattery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with\r\nhis jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space\r\nbetween his legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but\r\nhe didn’t make much headway, I thought.\r\n\r\nAt last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an\r\nadjoining room. It was cold as Iceland—no fire at all—the landlord said\r\nhe couldn’t afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a\r\nwinding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold\r\nto our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But the\r\nfare was of the most substantial kind—not only meat and potatoes, but\r\ndumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in a\r\ngreen box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n“My boy,” said the landlord, “you’ll have the nightmare to a dead\r\nsartainty.”\r\n\r\n“Landlord,” I whispered, “that aint the harpooneer is it?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no,” said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, “the\r\nharpooneer is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he\r\ndon’t—he eats nothing but steaks, and he likes ’em rare.”\r\n\r\n“The devil he does,” says I. “Where is that harpooneer? Is he here?”\r\n\r\n“He’ll be here afore long,” was the answer.\r\n\r\nI could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this “dark\r\ncomplexioned” harpooneer. At any rate, I made up my mind that if it so\r\nturned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get into\r\nbed before I did.\r\n\r\nSupper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not\r\nwhat else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the\r\nevening as a looker on.\r\n\r\nPresently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the landlord\r\ncried, “That’s the Grampus’s crew. I seed her reported in the offing\r\nthis morning; a three years’ voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now\r\nwe’ll have the latest news from the Feegees.”\r\n\r\nA tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung\r\nopen, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their\r\nshaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters,\r\nall bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they\r\nseemed an eruption of bears from Labrador. They had just landed from\r\ntheir boat, and this was the first house they entered. No wonder, then,\r\nthat they made a straight wake for the whale’s mouth—the bar—when the\r\nwrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out\r\nbrimmers all round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon\r\nwhich Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he\r\nswore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never\r\nmind of how long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador,\r\nor on the weather side of an ice-island.\r\n\r\nThe liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even\r\nwith the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began\r\ncapering about most obstreperously.\r\n\r\nI observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though\r\nhe seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his\r\nown sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much\r\nnoise as the rest. This man interested me at once; and since the\r\nsea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though\r\nbut a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I\r\nwill here venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six\r\nfeet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I\r\nhave seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and\r\nburnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the\r\ndeep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem\r\nto give him much joy. His voice at once announced that he was a\r\nSoutherner, and from his fine stature, I thought he must be one of\r\nthose tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When\r\nthe revelry of his companions had mounted to its height, this man\r\nslipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my\r\ncomrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his\r\nshipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge favourite with\r\nthem, they raised a cry of “Bulkington! Bulkington! where’s\r\nBulkington?” and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.\r\n\r\nIt was now about nine o’clock, and the room seeming almost\r\nsupernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself\r\nupon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the\r\nentrance of the seamen.\r\n\r\nNo man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal\r\nrather not sleep with your own brother. I don’t know how it is, but\r\npeople like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to\r\nsleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town,\r\nand that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely\r\nmultiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should\r\nsleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep\r\ntwo in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they all\r\nsleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and\r\ncover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.\r\n\r\nThe more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the\r\nthought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a\r\nharpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of\r\nthe tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over.\r\nBesides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be home\r\nand going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at\r\nmidnight—how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?\r\n\r\n“Landlord! I’ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.—I shan’t sleep\r\nwith him. I’ll try the bench here.”\r\n\r\n“Just as you please; I’m sorry I can’t spare ye a tablecloth for a\r\nmattress, and it’s a plaguy rough board here”—feeling of the knots and\r\nnotches. “But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I’ve got a carpenter’s plane\r\nthere in the bar—wait, I say, and I’ll make ye snug enough.” So saying\r\nhe procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting\r\nthe bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning\r\nlike an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the\r\nplane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was\r\nnear spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven’s sake to quit—the\r\nbed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing\r\nin the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the\r\nshavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in\r\nthe middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a\r\nbrown study.\r\n\r\nI now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too\r\nshort; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too\r\nnarrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher\r\nthan the planed one—so there was no yoking them. I then placed the\r\nfirst bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,\r\nleaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I\r\nsoon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from\r\nunder the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all,\r\nespecially as another current from the rickety door met the one from\r\nthe window, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in\r\nthe immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn’t I steal\r\na march on him—bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be\r\nwakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon\r\nsecond thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next\r\nmorning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be\r\nstanding in the entry, all ready to knock me down!\r\n\r\nStill, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of\r\nspending a sufferable night unless in some other person’s bed, I began\r\nto think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices\r\nagainst this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I’ll wait awhile; he must be\r\ndropping in before long. I’ll have a good look at him then, and perhaps\r\nwe may become jolly good bedfellows after all—there’s no telling.\r\n\r\nBut though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes,\r\nand going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.\r\n\r\n“Landlord!” said I, “what sort of a chap is he—does he always keep such\r\nlate hours?” It was now hard upon twelve o’clock.\r\n\r\nThe landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be\r\nmightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. “No,” he\r\nanswered, “generally he’s an early bird—airley to bed and airley to\r\nrise—yes, he’s the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he went out\r\na peddling, you see, and I don’t see what on airth keeps him so late,\r\nunless, may be, he can’t sell his head.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t sell his head?—What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are\r\ntelling me?” getting into a towering rage. “Do you pretend to say,\r\nlandlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed\r\nSaturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around\r\nthis town?”\r\n\r\n“That’s precisely it,” said the landlord, “and I told him he couldn’t\r\nsell it here, the market’s overstocked.”\r\n\r\n“With what?” shouted I.\r\n\r\n“With heads to be sure; ain’t there too many heads in the world?”\r\n\r\n“I tell you what it is, landlord,” said I quite calmly, “you’d better\r\nstop spinning that yarn to me—I’m not green.”\r\n\r\n“May be not,” taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, “but I\r\nrayther guess you’ll be done _brown_ if that ere harpooneer hears you a\r\nslanderin’ his head.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll break it for him,” said I, now flying into a passion again at\r\nthis unaccountable farrago of the landlord’s.\r\n\r\n“It’s broke a’ready,” said he.\r\n\r\n“Broke,” said I—“_broke_, do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Sartain, and that’s the very reason he can’t sell it, I guess.”\r\n\r\n“Landlord,” said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a\r\nsnow-storm—“landlord, stop whittling. You and I must understand one\r\nanother, and that too without delay. I come to your house and want a\r\nbed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half\r\nbelongs to a certain harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I have\r\nnot yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and\r\nexasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling\r\ntowards the man whom you design for my bedfellow—a sort of connexion,\r\nlandlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest\r\ndegree. I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this\r\nharpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the\r\nnight with him. And in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay\r\nthat story about selling his head, which if true I take to be good\r\nevidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I’ve no idea of\r\nsleeping with a madman; and you, sir, _you_ I mean, landlord, _you_,\r\nsir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render\r\nyourself liable to a criminal prosecution.”\r\n\r\n“Wall,” said the landlord, fetching a long breath, “that’s a purty long\r\nsarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then. But be easy, be\r\neasy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin’ you of has just arrived\r\nfrom the south seas, where he bought up a lot of ’balmed New Zealand\r\nheads (great curios, you know), and he’s sold all on ’em but one, and\r\nthat one he’s trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow’s Sunday, and it\r\nwould not do to be sellin’ human heads about the streets when folks is\r\ngoin’ to churches. He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just as\r\nhe was goin’ out of the door with four heads strung on a string, for\r\nall the airth like a string of inions.”\r\n\r\nThis account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed\r\nthat the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me—but at the\r\nsame time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a\r\nSaturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal\r\nbusiness as selling the heads of dead idolators?\r\n\r\n“Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.”\r\n\r\n“He pays reg’lar,” was the rejoinder. “But come, it’s getting dreadful\r\nlate, you had better be turning flukes—it’s a nice bed; Sal and me\r\nslept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There’s plenty of room\r\nfor two to kick about in that bed; it’s an almighty big bed that. Why,\r\nafore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the\r\nfoot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and\r\nsomehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm.\r\nArter that, Sal said it wouldn’t do. Come along here, I’ll give ye a\r\nglim in a jiffy;” and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards\r\nme, offering to lead the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a\r\nclock in the corner, he exclaimed “I vum it’s Sunday—you won’t see that\r\nharpooneer to-night; he’s come to anchor somewhere—come along then;\r\n_do_ come; _won’t_ ye come?”\r\n\r\nI considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was\r\nushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough,\r\nwith a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four\r\nharpooneers to sleep abreast.\r\n\r\n“There,” said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest\r\nthat did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; “there, make\r\nyourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.” I turned round from\r\neyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.\r\n\r\nFolding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of\r\nthe most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then\r\nglanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table,\r\ncould see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf,\r\nthe four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a\r\nwhale. Of things not properly belonging to the room, there was a\r\nhammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a\r\nlarge seaman’s bag, containing the harpooneer’s wardrobe, no doubt in\r\nlieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone\r\nfish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon\r\nstanding at the head of the bed.\r\n\r\nBut what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the\r\nlight, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to\r\narrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it\r\nto nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little\r\ntinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an\r\nIndian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as\r\nyou see the same in South American ponchos. But could it be possible\r\nthat any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the\r\nstreets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to\r\ntry it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy\r\nand thick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious\r\nharpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit\r\nof glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my\r\nlife. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink\r\nin the neck.\r\n\r\nI sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this\r\nhead-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on\r\nthe bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in\r\nthe middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought a\r\nlittle more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now,\r\nhalf undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about\r\nthe harpooneer’s not coming home at all that night, it being so very\r\nlate, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots,\r\nand then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself\r\nto the care of heaven.\r\n\r\nWhether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,\r\nthere is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not\r\nsleep for a long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had\r\npretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard\r\na heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into\r\nthe room from under the door.\r\n\r\nLord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal\r\nhead-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word\r\ntill spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New\r\nZealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without\r\nlooking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on\r\nthe floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted\r\ncords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was\r\nall eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time\r\nwhile employed in unlacing the bag’s mouth. This accomplished, however,\r\nhe turned round—when, good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was\r\nof a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with\r\nlarge blackish looking squares. Yes, it’s just as I thought, he’s a\r\nterrible bedfellow; he’s been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here\r\nhe is, just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his\r\nface so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be\r\nsticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They were\r\nstains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this;\r\nbut soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story\r\nof a white man—a whaleman too—who, falling among the cannibals, had\r\nbeen tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course\r\nof his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And\r\nwhat is it, thought I, after all! It’s only his outside; a man can be\r\nhonest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly\r\ncomplexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely\r\nindependent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be\r\nnothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot\r\nsun’s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had\r\nnever been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these\r\nextraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were\r\npassing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at\r\nall. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced\r\nfumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a\r\nseal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in\r\nthe middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head—a ghastly\r\nthing enough—and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his\r\nhat—a new beaver hat—when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.\r\nThere was no hair on his head—none to speak of at least—nothing but a\r\nsmall scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head now\r\nlooked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger\r\nstood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker\r\nthan ever I bolted a dinner.\r\n\r\nEven as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but\r\nit was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of this\r\nhead-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension.\r\nIgnorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and\r\nconfounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of\r\nhim as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at\r\nthe dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game\r\nenough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer\r\nconcerning what seemed inexplicable in him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed\r\nhis chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were\r\ncheckered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all\r\nover the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years’\r\nWar, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still\r\nmore, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs\r\nwere running up the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain that\r\nhe must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman\r\nin the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to\r\nthink of it. A peddler of heads too—perhaps the heads of his own\r\nbrothers. He might take a fancy to mine—heavens! look at that tomahawk!\r\n\r\nBut there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about\r\nsomething that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me\r\nthat he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall,\r\nor dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in\r\nthe pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image\r\nwith a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days’ old\r\nCongo baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought\r\nthat this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar\r\nmanner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened\r\na good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing\r\nbut a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage\r\ngoes up to the empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board,\r\nsets up this little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the\r\nandirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty,\r\nso that I thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine\r\nor chapel for his Congo idol.\r\n\r\nI now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but\r\nill at ease meantime—to see what was next to follow. First he takes\r\nabout a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places\r\nthem carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on\r\ntop and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into\r\na sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the\r\nfire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed\r\nto be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the\r\nbiscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite\r\noffer of it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to\r\nfancy such dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these\r\nstrange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from\r\nthe devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing\r\nsome pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in\r\nthe most unnatural manner. At last extinguishing the fire, he took the\r\nidol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket\r\nas carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.\r\n\r\nAll these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing\r\nhim now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business\r\noperations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,\r\nnow or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in which\r\nI had so long been bound.\r\n\r\nBut the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.\r\nTaking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for\r\nan instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the\r\nhandle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment\r\nthe light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between\r\nhis teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it\r\nnow; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.\r\n\r\nStammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him\r\nagainst the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might\r\nbe, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his\r\nguttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\n“Who-e debel you?”—he at last said—“you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.”\r\nAnd so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the\r\ndark.\r\n\r\n“Landlord, for God’s sake, Peter Coffin!” shouted I. “Landlord! Watch!\r\nCoffin! Angels! save me!”\r\n\r\n“Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!” again growled the\r\ncannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the\r\nhot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire.\r\nBut thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light\r\nin hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be afraid now,” said he, grinning again, “Queequeg here wouldn’t\r\nharm a hair of your head.”\r\n\r\n“Stop your grinning,” shouted I, “and why didn’t you tell me that that\r\ninfernal harpooneer was a cannibal?”\r\n\r\n“I thought ye know’d it;—didn’t I tell ye, he was a peddlin’ heads\r\naround town?—but turn flukes again and go to sleep. Queequeg, look\r\nhere—you sabbee me, I sabbee—you this man sleepe you—you sabbee?”\r\n\r\n“Me sabbee plenty”—grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and\r\nsitting up in bed.\r\n\r\n“You gettee in,” he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and\r\nthrowing the clothes to one side. He really did this in not only a\r\ncivil but a really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a\r\nmoment. For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely\r\nlooking cannibal. What’s all this fuss I have been making about,\r\nthought I to myself—the man’s a human being just as I am: he has just\r\nas much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep\r\nwith a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.\r\n\r\n“Landlord,” said I, “tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or\r\nwhatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will\r\nturn in with him. But I don’t fancy having a man smoking in bed with\r\nme. It’s dangerous. Besides, I ain’t insured.”\r\n\r\nThis being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely\r\nmotioned me to get into bed—rolling over to one side as much as to\r\nsay—“I won’t touch a leg of ye.”\r\n\r\n“Good night, landlord,” said I, “you may go.”\r\n\r\nI turned in, and never slept better in my life.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4. The Counterpane.\r\n\r\nUpon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg’s arm thrown\r\nover me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost\r\nthought I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of\r\nodd little parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his\r\ntattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no\r\ntwo parts of which were of one precise shade—owing I suppose to his\r\nkeeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt\r\nsleeves irregularly rolled up at various times—this same arm of his, I\r\nsay, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork\r\nquilt. Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I\r\ncould hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues\r\ntogether; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I\r\ncould tell that Queequeg was hugging me.\r\n\r\nMy sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a\r\nchild, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;\r\nwhether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle. The\r\ncircumstance was this. I had been cutting up some caper or other—I\r\nthink it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little\r\nsweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other,\r\nwas all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,—my\r\nmother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to\r\nbed, though it was only two o’clock in the afternoon of the 21st June,\r\nthe longest day in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But\r\nthere was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the\r\nthird floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time,\r\nand with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.\r\n\r\nI lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse\r\nbefore I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the small\r\nof my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too; the sun\r\nshining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the\r\nstreets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse\r\nand worse—at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my\r\nstockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself at\r\nher feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good\r\nslippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to\r\nlie abed such an unendurable length of time. But she was the best and\r\nmost conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For\r\nseveral hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than\r\nI have ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes.\r\nAt last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and\r\nslowly waking from it—half steeped in dreams—I opened my eyes, and the\r\nbefore sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt\r\na shock running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and\r\nnothing was to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.\r\nMy arm hung over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable,\r\nsilent form or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely\r\nseated by my bed-side. For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there,\r\nfrozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet\r\never thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid\r\nspell would be broken. I knew not how this consciousness at last glided\r\naway from me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it\r\nall, and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in\r\nconfounding attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I\r\noften puzzle myself with it.\r\n\r\nNow, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the\r\nsupernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to\r\nthose which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg’s pagan arm\r\nthrown round me. But at length all the past night’s events soberly\r\nrecurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to\r\nthe comical predicament. For though I tried to move his arm—unlock his\r\nbridegroom clasp—yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly,\r\nas though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to rouse\r\nhim—“Queequeg!”—but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled over, my\r\nneck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a\r\nslight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk\r\nsleeping by the savage’s side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby. A\r\npretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in the\r\nbroad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! “Queequeg!—in the name of\r\ngoodness, Queequeg, wake!” At length, by dint of much wriggling, and\r\nloud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his\r\nhugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in\r\nextracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself\r\nall over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in\r\nbed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if\r\nhe did not altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim\r\nconsciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over\r\nhim. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings\r\nnow, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at\r\nlast, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow,\r\nand he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon\r\nthe floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that,\r\nif it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress\r\nafterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg,\r\nunder the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the\r\ntruth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you\r\nwill; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this\r\nparticular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much\r\ncivility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness;\r\nstaring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for\r\nthe time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding. Nevertheless,\r\na man like Queequeg you don’t see every day, he and his ways were well\r\nworth unusual regarding.\r\n\r\nHe commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall\r\none, by the by, and then—still minus his trowsers—he hunted up his\r\nboots. What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his\r\nnext movement was to crush himself—boots in hand, and hat on—under the\r\nbed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he\r\nwas hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I\r\never heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his\r\nboots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition\r\nstage—neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized\r\nto show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His\r\neducation was not yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not\r\nbeen a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled\r\nhimself with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage,\r\nhe never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At\r\nlast, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over\r\nhis eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not\r\nbeing much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide\r\nones—probably not made to order either—rather pinched and tormented him\r\nat the first go off of a bitter cold morning.\r\n\r\nSeeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the\r\nstreet being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view\r\ninto the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that\r\nQueequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on;\r\nI begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and\r\nparticularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible. He\r\ncomplied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in the\r\nmorning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my\r\namazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his\r\nchest, arms, and hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a\r\npiece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water\r\nand commenced lathering his face. I was watching to see where he kept\r\nhis razor, when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed\r\ncorner, slips out the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it\r\na little on his boot, and striding up to the bit of mirror against the\r\nwall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.\r\nThinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers’s best cutlery with a\r\nvengeance. Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came\r\nto know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how\r\nexceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept.\r\n\r\nThe rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of\r\nthe room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his\r\nharpoon like a marshal’s baton.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5. Breakfast.\r\n\r\nI quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the\r\ngrinning landlord very pleasantly. I cherished no malice towards him,\r\nthough he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my\r\nbedfellow.\r\n\r\nHowever, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a\r\ngood thing; the more’s the pity. So, if any one man, in his own proper\r\nperson, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be\r\nbackward, but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in\r\nthat way. And the man that has anything bountifully laughable about\r\nhim, be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for.\r\n\r\nThe bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the\r\nnight previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at. They were\r\nnearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates,\r\nand sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and\r\nharpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown and brawny company, with bosky\r\nbeards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning\r\ngowns.\r\n\r\nYou could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore. This\r\nyoung fellow’s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and\r\nwould seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days\r\nlanded from his Indian voyage. That man next him looks a few shades\r\nlighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him. In the\r\ncomplexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly\r\nbleached withal; _he_ doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore. But who\r\ncould show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various tints,\r\nseemed like the Andes’ western slope, to show forth in one array,\r\ncontrasting climates, zone by zone.\r\n\r\n“Grub, ho!” now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we\r\nwent to breakfast.\r\n\r\nThey say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease\r\nin manner, quite self-possessed in company. Not always, though:\r\nLedyard, the great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch\r\none; of all men, they possessed the least assurance in the parlor. But\r\nperhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as\r\nLedyard did, or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in\r\nthe negro heart of Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo’s\r\nperformances—this kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best mode\r\nof attaining a high social polish. Still, for the most part, that sort\r\nof thing is to be had anywhere.\r\n\r\nThese reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that\r\nafter we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear some\r\ngood stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every man\r\nmaintained a profound silence. And not only that, but they looked\r\nembarrassed. Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom without the\r\nslightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas—entire\r\nstrangers to them—and duelled them dead without winking; and yet, here\r\nthey sat at a social breakfast table—all of the same calling, all of\r\nkindred tastes—looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they\r\nhad never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green\r\nMountains. A curious sight; these bashful bears, these timid warrior\r\nwhalemen!\r\n\r\nBut as for Queequeg—why, Queequeg sat there among them—at the head of\r\nthe table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle. To be sure I\r\ncannot say much for his breeding. His greatest admirer could not have\r\ncordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him,\r\nand using it there without ceremony; reaching over the table with it,\r\nto the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks\r\ntowards him. But _that_ was certainly very coolly done by him, and\r\nevery one knows that in most people’s estimation, to do anything coolly\r\nis to do it genteelly.\r\n\r\nWe will not speak of all Queequeg’s peculiarities here; how he eschewed\r\ncoffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to\r\nbeefsteaks, done rare. Enough, that when breakfast was over he withdrew\r\nlike the rest into the public room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was\r\nsitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat\r\non, when I sallied out for a stroll.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6. The Street.\r\n\r\nIf I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish\r\nan individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a\r\ncivilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first\r\ndaylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford.\r\n\r\nIn thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will\r\nfrequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign\r\nparts. Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners\r\nwill sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies. Regent Street is not\r\nunknown to Lascars and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green, live\r\nYankees have often scared the natives. But New Bedford beats all Water\r\nStreet and Wapping. In these last-mentioned haunts you see only\r\nsailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at street\r\ncorners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy\r\nflesh. It makes a stranger stare.\r\n\r\nBut, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians,\r\nand Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft\r\nwhich unheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still\r\nmore curious, certainly more comical. There weekly arrive in this town\r\nscores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain\r\nand glory in the fishery. They are mostly young, of stalwart frames;\r\nfellows who have felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and\r\nsnatch the whale-lance. Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence\r\nthey came. In some things you would think them but a few hours old.\r\nLook there! that chap strutting round the corner. He wears a beaver hat\r\nand swallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife.\r\nHere comes another with a sou’-wester and a bombazine cloak.\r\n\r\nNo town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one—I mean a\r\ndownright bumpkin dandy—a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his\r\ntwo acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a\r\ncountry dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished\r\nreputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you should see the\r\ncomical things he does upon reaching the seaport. In bespeaking his\r\nsea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats; straps to his\r\ncanvas trowsers. Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will burst those\r\nstraps in the first howling gale, when thou art driven, straps,\r\nbuttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest.\r\n\r\nBut think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals,\r\nand bumpkins to show her visitors. Not at all. Still New Bedford is a\r\nqueer place. Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would\r\nthis day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of\r\nLabrador. As it is, parts of her back country are enough to frighten\r\none, they look so bony. The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to\r\nlive in, in all New England. It is a land of oil, true enough: but not\r\nlike Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine. The streets do not run\r\nwith milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs.\r\nYet, in spite of this, nowhere in all America will you find more\r\npatrician-like houses; parks and gardens more opulent, than in New\r\nBedford. Whence came they? how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of\r\na country?\r\n\r\nGo and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty\r\nmansion, and your question will be answered. Yes; all these brave\r\nhouses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian\r\noceans. One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the\r\nbottom of the sea. Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that?\r\n\r\nIn New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their\r\ndaughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece.\r\nYou must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say,\r\nthey have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly\r\nburn their lengths in spermaceti candles.\r\n\r\nIn summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples—long\r\navenues of green and gold. And in August, high in air, the beautiful\r\nand bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by\r\ntheir tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms. So omnipotent is\r\nart; which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright\r\nterraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at\r\ncreation’s final day.\r\n\r\nAnd the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses. But\r\nroses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of "

A public place.\r\n\r\n\r\n Enter Sampson and Gregory armed with swords and bucklers.\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nGregory, on my word, we’ll not carry coals.\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\nNo, for then we should be colliers.\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nI mean, if we be in choler, we’ll draw.\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\nAy, while you live, draw your neck out o’ the collar.\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nI strike quickly, being moved.\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\nBut thou art not quickly moved to strike.\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nA dog of the house of Montague moves me.\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\nTo move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thou\r\nart moved, thou runn’st away.\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nA dog of that house shall move me to stand.\r\nI will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\nThat shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall.\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nTrue, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to\r\nthe wall: therefore I will push Montague’s men from the wall, and\r\nthrust his maids to the wall.\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\nThe quarrel is between our masters and us their men.\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\n’Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the\r\nmen I will be civil with the maids, I will cut off their heads.\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\nThe heads of the maids?\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nAy, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense\r\nthou wilt.\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\nThey must take it in sense that feel it.\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nMe they shall feel while I am able to stand: and ’tis known I am a\r\npretty piece of flesh.\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\n’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor John.\r\nDraw thy tool; here comes of the house of Montagues.\r\n\r\n Enter Abram and Balthasar.\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nMy naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\nHow? Turn thy back and run?\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nFear me not.\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\nNo, marry; I fear thee!\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nLet us take the law of our sides; let them begin.\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\nI will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nNay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to\r\nthem if they bear it.\r\n\r\nABRAM.\r\nDo you bite your thumb at us, sir?\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nI do bite my thumb, sir.\r\n\r\nABRAM.\r\nDo you bite your thumb at us, sir?\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nIs the law of our side if I say ay?\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nNo sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my thumb, sir.\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\nDo you quarrel, sir?\r\n\r\nABRAM.\r\nQuarrel, sir?

This is that very Mab\r\nThat plats the manes of horses in the night;\r\nAnd bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,\r\nWhich, once untangled, much misfortune bodes:\r\nThis is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,\r\nThat presses them, and learns them first to bear,\r\nMaking them women of good carriage:\r\nThis is she,—\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nPeace, peace, Mercutio, peace,\r\nThou talk’st of nothing.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nTrue, I talk of dreams,\r\nWhich are the children of an idle brain,\r\nBegot of nothing but vain fantasy,\r\nWhich is as thin of substance as the air,\r\nAnd more inconstant than the wind, who woos\r\nEven now the frozen bosom of the north,\r\nAnd, being anger’d, puffs away from thence,\r\nTurning his side to the dew-dropping south.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nThis wind you talk of blows us from ourselves:\r\nSupper is done, and we shall come too late.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI fear too early: for my mind misgives\r\nSome consequence yet hanging in the stars,\r\nShall bitterly begin his fearful date\r\nWith this night’s revels; and expire the term\r\nOf a despised life, clos’d in my breast\r\nBy some vile forfeit of untimely death.\r\nBut he that hath the steerage of my course\r\nDirect my suit.

I know thou wilt say Ay,\r\nAnd I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear’st,\r\nThou mayst prove false. At lovers’ perjuries,\r\nThey say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,\r\nIf thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.\r\nOr if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,\r\nI’ll frown and be perverse, and say thee nay,\r\nSo thou wilt woo. But else, not for the world.\r\nIn truth, fair Montague, I am too fond;\r\nAnd therefore thou mayst think my ’haviour light:\r\nBut trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more true\r\nThan those that have more cunning to be strange.\r\nI should have been more strange, I must confess,\r\nBut that thou overheard’st, ere I was ’ware,\r\nMy true-love passion; therefore pardon me,\r\nAnd not impute this yielding to light love,\r\nWhich the dark night hath so discovered.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nLady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,\r\nThat tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops,—\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nO swear not by the moon, th’inconstant moon,\r\nThat monthly changes in her circled orb,\r\nLest that thy love prove likewise variable.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nWhat shall I swear by?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nDo not swear at all.\r\nOr if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,\r\nWhich is the god of my idolatry,\r\nAnd I’ll believe thee.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nIf my heart’s dear love,—\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nWell, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,\r\nI have no joy of this contract tonight;\r\nIt is too rash, too unadvis’d, too sudden,\r\nToo like the lightning, which doth cease to be\r\nEre one can say “It lightens.” Sweet, good night.\r\nThis bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath,\r\nMay prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.\r\nGood night, good night. As sweet repose and rest\r\nCome to thy heart as that within my breast.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nO wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nWhat satisfaction canst thou have tonight?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nTh’exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nI gave thee mine before thou didst request it;\r\nAnd yet I would it were to give again.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nWould’st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nBut to be frank and give it thee again.\r\nAnd yet I wish but for the thing I have;\r\nMy bounty is as boundless as the sea,\r\nMy love as deep; the more I give to thee,\r\nThe more I have, for both are infinite.\r\nI hear some noise within.

O for a falconer’s voice\r\nTo lure this tassel-gentle back again.\r\nBondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud,\r\nElse would I tear the cave where Echo lies,\r\nAnd make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine\r\nWith repetition of my Romeo’s name.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nIt is my soul that calls upon my name.\r\nHow silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night,\r\nLike softest music to attending ears.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nRomeo.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nMy dear?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nWhat o’clock tomorrow\r\nShall I send to thee?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nBy the hour of nine.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nI will not fail. ’Tis twenty years till then.\r\nI have forgot why I did call thee back.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nLet me stand here till thou remember it.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nI shall forget, to have thee still stand there,\r\nRemembering how I love thy company.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAnd I’ll still stay, to have thee still forget,\r\nForgetting any other home but this.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\n’Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone,\r\nAnd yet no farther than a wanton’s bird,\r\nThat lets it hop a little from her hand,\r\nLike a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,\r\nAnd with a silk thread plucks it back again,\r\nSo loving-jealous of his liberty.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI would I were thy bird.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nSweet, so would I:\r\nYet I should kill thee with much cherishing.\r\nGood night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow\r\nThat I shall say good night till it be morrow.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nSleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.\r\nWould I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest.\r\nHence will I to my ghostly Sire’s cell,\r\nHis help to crave and my dear hap to tell.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.\r\n\r\n Enter Friar Lawrence with a basket.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nThe grey-ey’d morn smiles on the frowning night,\r\nChequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light;\r\nAnd fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels\r\nFrom forth day’s pathway, made by Titan’s fiery wheels\r\nNow, ere the sun advance his burning eye,\r\nThe day to cheer, and night’s dank dew to dry,\r\nI must upfill this osier cage of ours\r\nWith baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.\r\nThe earth that’s nature’s mother, is her tomb;\r\nWhat is her burying grave, that is her womb:\r\nAnd from her womb children of divers kind\r\nWe sucking on her natural bosom find.\r\nMany for many virtues excellent,\r\nNone but for some, and yet all different.\r\nO, mickle is the powerful grace that lies\r\nIn plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities.\r\nFor naught so vile that on the earth doth live\r\nBut to the earth some special good doth give;\r\nNor aught so good but, strain’d from that fair use,\r\nRevolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.\r\nVirtue itself turns vice being misapplied,\r\nAnd vice sometime’s by action dignified.\r\n\r\n Enter Romeo.\r\n\r\nWithin the infant rind of this weak flower\r\nPoison hath residence, and medicine power:\r\nFor this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;\r\nBeing tasted, slays all senses with the heart.\r\nTwo such opposed kings encamp them still\r\nIn man as well as herbs,—grace and rude will;\r\nAnd where the worser is predominant,\r\nFull soon the canker death eats up that plant.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nGood morrow, father.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nBenedicite!\r\nWhat early tongue so sweet saluteth me?\r\nYoung son, it argues a distemper’d head\r\nSo soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.\r\nCare keeps his watch in every old man’s eye,\r\nAnd where care lodges sleep will never lie;\r\nBut where unbruised youth with unstuff’d brain\r\nDoth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.\r\nTherefore thy earliness doth me assure\r\nThou art uprous’d with some distemperature;\r\nOr if not so, then here I hit it right,\r\nOur Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nThat last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nGod pardon sin. Wast thou with Rosaline?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nWith Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.\r\nI have forgot that name, and that name’s woe.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nThat’s my good son. But where hast thou been then?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.\r\nI have been feasting with mine enemy,\r\nWhere on a sudden one hath wounded me\r\nThat’s by me wounded. Both our remedies\r\nWithin thy help and holy physic lies.\r\nI bear no hatred, blessed man; for lo,\r\nMy intercession likewise steads my foe.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nBe plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;\r\nRiddling confession finds but riddling shrift.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nThen plainly know my heart’s dear love is set\r\nOn the fair daughter of rich Capulet.\r\nAs mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;\r\nAnd all combin’d, save what thou must combine\r\nBy holy marriage. When, and where, and how\r\nWe met, we woo’d, and made exchange of vow,\r\nI’ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,\r\nThat thou consent to marry us today.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nHoly Saint Francis! What a change is here!\r\nIs Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,\r\nSo soon forsaken? Young men’s love then lies\r\nNot truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.\r\nJesu Maria, what a deal of brine\r\nHath wash’d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!\r\nHow much salt water thrown away in waste,\r\nTo season love, that of it doth not taste.\r\nThe sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,\r\nThy old groans yet ring in mine ancient ears.\r\nLo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit\r\nOf an old tear that is not wash’d off yet.\r\nIf ere thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,\r\nThou and these woes were all for Rosaline,\r\nAnd art thou chang’d? Pronounce this sentence then,\r\nWomen may fall, when there’s no strength in men.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nThou chidd’st me oft for loving Rosaline.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nFor doting, not for loving, pupil mine.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAnd bad’st me bury love.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nNot in a grave\r\nTo lay one in, another out to have.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI pray thee chide me not, her I love now\r\nDoth grace for grace and love for love allow.\r\nThe other did not so.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nO, she knew well\r\nThy love did read by rote, that could not spell.\r\nBut come young waverer, come go with me,\r\nIn one respect I’ll thy assistant be;\r\nFor this alliance may so happy prove,\r\nTo turn your households’ rancour to pure love.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nO let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nWisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. A Street.\r\n\r\n Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nWhere the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home tonight?\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nNot to his father’s; I spoke with his man.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nWhy, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, torments him so\r\nthat he will sure run mad.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nTybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, hath sent a letter to his father’s\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nA challenge, on my life.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nRomeo will answer it.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nAny man that can write may answer a letter.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nNay, he will answer the letter’s master, how he dares, being dared.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nAlas poor Romeo, he is already dead, stabbed with a white wench’s black\r\neye; run through the ear with a love song, the very pin of his heart\r\ncleft with the blind bow-boy’s butt-shaft. And is he a man to encounter\r\nTybalt?\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nWhy, what is Tybalt?\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nMore than Prince of cats. O, he’s the courageous captain of\r\ncompliments. He fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance,\r\nand proportion. He rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in\r\nyour bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist;\r\na gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah,\r\nthe immortal passado, the punto reverso, the hay.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nThe what?\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nThe pox of such antic lisping, affecting phantasies; these new tuners\r\nof accent. By Jesu, a very good blade, a very tall man, a very good\r\nwhore. Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that we should\r\nbe thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers,\r\nthese pardon-me’s, who stand so much on the new form that they cannot\r\nsit at ease on the old bench? O their bones, their bones!\r\n\r\n Enter Romeo.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nHere comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nWithout his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how art thou\r\nfishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in. Laura, to\r\nhis lady, was but a kitchen wench,—marry, she had a better love to\r\nberhyme her: Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gypsy; Helen and Hero hildings\r\nand harlots; Thisbe a grey eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior\r\nRomeo, bonjour! There’s a French salutation to your French slop. You\r\ngave us the counterfeit fairly last night.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nGood morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nThe slip sir, the slip; can you not conceive?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nPardon, good Mercutio, my business was great, and in such a case as\r\nmine a man may strain courtesy.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nThat’s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow\r\nin the hams.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nMeaning, to curtsy.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nThou hast most kindly hit it.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nA most courteous exposition.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nNay, I am the very pink of courtesy.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nPink for flower.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nRight.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nWhy, then is my pump well flowered.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nSure wit, follow me this jest now, till thou hast worn out thy pump,\r\nthat when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain after the\r\nwearing, solely singular.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nO single-soled jest, solely singular for the singleness!\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nCome between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nSwits and spurs, swits and spurs; or I’ll cry a match.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nNay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done. For thou hast\r\nmore of the wild-goose in one of thy wits, than I am sure, I have in my\r\nwhole five. Was I with you there for the goose?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nThou wast never with me for anything, when thou wast not there for the\r\ngoose.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nI will bite thee by the ear for that jest.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nNay, good goose, bite not.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nThy wit is a very bitter sweeting, it is a most sharp sauce.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAnd is it not then well served in to a sweet goose?\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nO here’s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an\r\nell broad.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI stretch it out for that word broad, which added to the goose, proves\r\nthee far and wide a broad goose.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nWhy, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now art thou\r\nsociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as\r\nwell as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a great natural,\r\nthat runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nStop there, stop there.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nThou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nThou wouldst else have made thy tale large.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nO, thou art deceived; I would have made it short, for I was come to the\r\nwhole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the argument no\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n Enter Nurse and Peter.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nHere’s goodly gear!\r\nA sail, a sail!\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nTwo, two; a shirt and a smock.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nPeter!\r\n\r\nPETER.\r\nAnon.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nMy fan, Peter.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nGood Peter, to hide her face; for her fan’s the fairer face.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nGod ye good morrow, gentlemen.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nGod ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nIs it good-den?\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\n’Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the\r\nprick of noon.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nOut upon you! What a man are you?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nOne, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nBy my troth, it is well said; for himself to mar, quoth a? Gentlemen,\r\ncan any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI can tell you: but young Romeo will be older when you have found him\r\nthan he was when you sought him. I am the youngest of that name, for\r\nfault of a worse.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nYou say well.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nYea, is the worst well? Very well took, i’faith; wisely, wisely.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nIf you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nShe will endite him to some supper.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nA bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nWhat hast thou found?\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nNo hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is something\r\nstale and hoar ere it be spent.\r\n[_Sings._]\r\n    An old hare hoar,\r\n    And an old hare hoar,\r\n  Is very good meat in Lent;\r\n    But a hare that is hoar\r\n    Is too much for a score\r\n  When it hoars ere it be spent.\r\nRomeo, will you come to your father’s? We’ll to dinner thither.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI will follow you.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nFarewell, ancient lady; farewell, lady, lady, lady.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nI pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his\r\nropery?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nA gentleman, Nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak\r\nmore in a minute than he will stand to in a month.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nAnd a speak anything against me, I’ll take him down, and a were lustier\r\nthan he is, and twenty such Jacks. And if I cannot, I’ll find those\r\nthat shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none of\r\nhis skains-mates.—And thou must stand by too and suffer every knave to\r\nuse me at his pleasure!\r\n\r\nPETER.\r\nI saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon should\r\nquickly have been out. I warrant you, I dare draw as soon as another\r\nman, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nNow, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me quivers. Scurvy\r\nknave. Pray you, sir, a word: and as I told you, my young lady bid me\r\nenquire you out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself. But first\r\nlet me tell ye, if ye should lead her in a fool’s paradise, as they\r\nsay, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say; for the\r\ngentlewoman is young. And therefore, if you should deal double with\r\nher, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and\r\nvery weak dealing.\r\n\r\nROMEO. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto\r\nthee,—\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nGood heart, and i’faith I will tell her as much. Lord, Lord, she will\r\nbe a joyful woman.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nWhat wilt thou tell her, Nurse? Thou dost not mark me.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nI will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I take it, is a\r\ngentlemanlike offer.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nBid her devise\r\nSome means to come to shrift this afternoon,\r\nAnd there she shall at Friar Lawrence’ cell\r\nBe shriv’d and married. Here is for thy pains.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nNo truly, sir; not a penny.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nGo to; I say you shall.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nThis afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAnd stay, good Nurse, behind the abbey wall.\r\nWithin this hour my man shall be with thee,\r\nAnd bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,\r\nWhich to the high topgallant of my joy\r\nMust be my convoy in the secret night.\r\nFarewell, be trusty, and I’ll quit thy pains;\r\nFarewell; commend me to thy mistress.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nNow God in heaven bless thee. Hark you, sir.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nWhat say’st thou, my dear Nurse?\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nIs your man secret? Did you ne’er hear say,\r\nTwo may keep counsel, putting one away?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI warrant thee my man’s as true as steel.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nWell, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord! When ’twas a\r\nlittle prating thing,—O, there is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that\r\nwould fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see a\r\ntoad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes, and tell her that\r\nParis is the properer man, but I’ll warrant you, when I say so, she\r\nlooks as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and\r\nRomeo begin both with a letter?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAy, Nurse; what of that? Both with an R.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nAh, mocker! That’s the dog’s name. R is for the—no, I know it begins\r\nwith some other letter, and she hath the prettiest sententious of it,\r\nof you and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nCommend me to thy lady.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nAy, a thousand times. Peter!\r\n\r\n [_Exit Romeo._]\r\n\r\nPETER.\r\nAnon.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nBefore and apace.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE V. Capulet’s Garden.\r\n\r\n Enter Juliet.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nThe clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse,\r\nIn half an hour she promised to return.\r\nPerchance she cannot meet him. That’s not so.\r\nO, she is lame. Love’s heralds should be thoughts,\r\nWhich ten times faster glides than the sun’s beams,\r\nDriving back shadows over lowering hills:\r\nTherefore do nimble-pinion’d doves draw love,\r\nAnd therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.\r\nNow is the sun upon the highmost hill\r\nOf this day’s journey, and from nine till twelve\r\nIs three long hours, yet she is not come.\r\nHad she affections and warm youthful blood,\r\nShe’d be as swift in motion as a ball;\r\nMy words would bandy her to my sweet love,\r\nAnd his to me.\r\nBut old folks, many feign as they were dead;\r\nUnwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.\r\n\r\n Enter Nurse and Peter.\r\n\r\nO God, she comes. O honey Nurse, what news?\r\nHast thou met with him? Send thy man away.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nPeter, stay at the gate.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Peter._]\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nNow, good sweet Nurse,—O Lord, why look’st thou sad?\r\nThough news be sad, yet tell them merrily;\r\nIf good, thou sham’st the music of sweet news\r\nBy playing it to me with so sour a face.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nI am aweary, give me leave awhile;\r\nFie, how my bones ache! What a jaunt have I had!\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nI would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:\r\nNay come, I pray thee speak; good, good Nurse, speak.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nJesu, what haste? Can you not stay a while? Do you not see that I am\r\nout of breath?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nHow art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath\r\nTo say to me that thou art out of breath?\r\nThe excuse that thou dost make in this delay\r\nIs longer than the tale thou dost excuse.\r\nIs thy news good or bad? Answer to that;\r\nSay either, and I’ll stay the circumstance.\r\nLet me be satisfied, is’t good or bad?\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nWell, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man.\r\nRomeo? No, not he. Though his face be better than any man’s, yet his\r\nleg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot, and a body, though\r\nthey be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He is not the\r\nflower of courtesy, but I’ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy\r\nways, wench, serve God. What, have you dined at home?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nNo, no. But all this did I know before.\r\nWhat says he of our marriage? What of that?\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nLord, how my head aches! What a head have I!\r\nIt beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.\r\nMy back o’ t’other side,—O my back, my back!\r\nBeshrew your heart for sending me about\r\nTo catch my death with jauncing up and down.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nI’faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.\r\nSweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love?\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nYour love says like an honest gentleman,\r\nAnd a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome,\r\nAnd I warrant a virtuous,—Where is your mother?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nWhere is my mother? Why, she is within.\r\nWhere should she be? How oddly thou repliest.\r\n‘Your love says, like an honest gentleman,\r\n‘Where is your mother?’\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nO God’s lady dear,\r\nAre you so hot? Marry, come up, I trow.\r\nIs this the poultice for my aching bones?\r\nHenceforward do your messages yourself.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nHere’s such a coil. Come, what says Romeo?\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nHave you got leave to go to shrift today?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nI have.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nThen hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’ cell;\r\nThere stays a husband to make you a wife.\r\nNow comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,\r\nThey’ll be in scarlet straight at any news.\r\nHie you to church. I must another way,\r\nTo fetch a ladder by the which your love\r\nMust climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark.\r\nI am the drudge, and toil in your delight;\r\nBut you shall bear the burden soon at night.\r\nGo. I’ll to dinner; hie you to the cell.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nHie to high fortune! Honest Nurse, farewell.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE VI. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.\r\n\r\n Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nSo smile the heavens upon this holy act\r\nThat after-hours with sorrow chide us not.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAmen, amen, but come what sorrow can,\r\nIt cannot countervail the exchange of joy\r\nThat one short minute gives me in her sight.\r\nDo thou but close our hands with holy words,\r\nThen love-devouring death do what he dare,\r\nIt is enough I may but call her mine.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nThese violent delights have violent ends,\r\nAnd in their triumph die; like fire and powder,\r\nWhich as they kiss consume. The sweetest honey\r\nIs loathsome in his own deliciousness,\r\nAnd in the taste confounds the appetite.\r\nTherefore love moderately: long love doth so;\r\nToo swift arrives as tardy as too slow.\r\n\r\n Enter Juliet.\r\n\r\nHere comes the lady. O, so light a foot\r\nWill ne’er wear out the everlasting flint.\r\nA lover may bestride the gossamers\r\nThat idles in the wanton summer air\r\nAnd yet not fall; so light is vanity.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nGood even to my ghostly confessor.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nRomeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nAs much to him, else is his thanks too much.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAh, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy\r\nBe heap’d like mine, and that thy skill be more\r\nTo blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath\r\nThis neighbour air, and let rich music’s tongue\r\nUnfold the imagin’d happiness that both\r\nReceive in either by this dear encounter.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nConceit more rich in matter than in words,\r\nBrags of his substance, not of ornament.\r\nThey are but beggars that can count their worth;\r\nBut my true love is grown to such excess,\r\nI cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nCome, come with me, and we will make short work,\r\nFor, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone\r\nTill holy church incorporate two in one.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT III\r\n\r\nSCENE I. A public Place.\r\n\r\n\r\n Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, Page and Servants.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nI pray thee, good Mercutio, let’s retire:\r\nThe day is hot, the Capulets abroad,\r\nAnd if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,\r\nFor now these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nThou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of\r\na tavern, claps me his sword upon the table, and says ‘God send me no\r\nneed of thee!’ and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the\r\ndrawer, when indeed there is no need.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nAm I like such a fellow?\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nCome, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy; and as\r\nsoon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nAnd what to?\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nNay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would\r\nkill the other. Thou? Why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a\r\nhair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel\r\nwith a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou\r\nhast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?\r\nThy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy\r\nhead hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast\r\nquarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath\r\nwakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall\r\nout with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with\r\nanother for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt\r\ntutor me from quarrelling!\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nAnd I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee\r\nsimple of my life for an hour and a quarter.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nThe fee simple! O simple!\r\n\r\n Enter Tybalt and others.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nBy my head, here comes the Capulets.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nBy my heel, I care not.\r\n\r\nTYBALT.\r\nFollow me close, for I will speak to them.\r\nGentlemen, good-den: a word with one of you.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nAnd but one word with one of us? Couple it with something; make it a\r\nword and a blow.\r\n\r\nTYBALT.\r\nYou shall find me apt enough to that, sir, and you will give me\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nCould you not take some occasion without giving?\r\n\r\nTYBALT.\r\nMercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nConsort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? And thou make minstrels of\r\nus, look to hear nothing but discords. Here’s my fiddlestick, here’s\r\nthat shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nWe talk here in the public haunt of men.\r\nEither withdraw unto some private place,\r\nAnd reason coldly of your grievances,\r\nOr else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nMen’s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.\r\nI will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.\r\n\r\n Enter Romeo.\r\n\r\nTYBALT.\r\nWell, peace be with you, sir, here comes my man.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nBut I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.\r\nMarry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower;\r\nYour worship in that sense may call him man.\r\n\r\nTYBALT.\r\nRomeo, the love I bear thee can afford\r\nNo better term than this: Thou art a villain.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nTybalt, the reason that I have to love thee\r\nDoth much excuse the appertaining rage\r\nTo such a greeting. Villain am I none;\r\nTherefore farewell; I see thou know’st me not.\r\n\r\nTYBALT.\r\nBoy, this shall not excuse the injuries\r\nThat thou hast done me, therefore turn and draw.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI do protest I never injur’d thee,\r\nBut love thee better than thou canst devise\r\nTill thou shalt know the reason of my love.\r\nAnd so good Capulet, which name I tender\r\nAs dearly as mine own, be satisfied.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nO calm, dishonourable, vile submission!\r\n[_Draws._] Alla stoccata carries it away.\r\nTybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?\r\n\r\nTYBALT.\r\nWhat wouldst thou have with me?\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nGood King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives; that I mean to\r\nmake bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest\r\nof the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears?\r\nMake haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.\r\n\r\nTYBALT.\r\n[_Drawing._] I am for you.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nGentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nCome, sir, your passado.\r\n\r\n [_They fight._]\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nDraw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.\r\nGentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage,\r\nTybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath\r\nForbid this bandying in Verona streets.\r\nHold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Tybalt with his Partizans._]\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nI am hurt.\r\nA plague o’ both your houses. I am sped.\r\nIs he gone, and hath nothing?\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nWhat, art thou hurt?\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nAy, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, ’tis enough.\r\nWhere is my page? Go villain, fetch a surgeon.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Page._]\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nCourage, man; the hurt cannot be much.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nNo, ’tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door, but ’tis\r\nenough, ’twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a\r\ngrave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o’ both\r\nyour houses. Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to\r\ndeath. A braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of\r\narithmetic!—Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your\r\narm.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI thought all for the best.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nHelp me into some house, Benvolio,\r\nOr I shall faint. A plague o’ both your houses.\r\nThey have made worms’ meat of me.\r\nI have it, and soundly too. Your houses!\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nThis gentleman, the Prince’s near ally,\r\nMy very friend, hath got his mortal hurt\r\nIn my behalf; my reputation stain’d\r\nWith Tybalt’s slander,—Tybalt, that an hour\r\nHath been my cousin. O sweet Juliet,\r\nThy beauty hath made me effeminate\r\nAnd in my temper soften’d valour’s steel.\r\n\r\n Re-enter Benvolio.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nO Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio’s dead,\r\nThat gallant spirit hath aspir’d the clouds,\r\nWhich too untimely here did scorn the earth.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nThis day’s black fate on mo days doth depend;\r\nThis but begins the woe others must end.\r\n\r\n Re-enter Tybalt.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nHere comes the furious Tybalt back again.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAgain in triumph, and Mercutio slain?\r\nAway to heaven respective lenity,\r\nAnd fire-ey’d fury be my conduct now!\r\nNow, Tybalt, take the ‘villain’ back again\r\nThat late thou gav’st me, for Mercutio’s soul\r\nIs but a little way above our heads,\r\nStaying for thine to keep him company.\r\nEither thou or I, or both, must go with him.\r\n\r\nTYBALT.\r\nThou wretched boy, that didst consort him here,\r\nShalt with him hence.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nThis shall determine that.\r\n\r\n [_They fight; Tybalt falls._]\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nRomeo, away, be gone!\r\nThe citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.\r\nStand not amaz’d. The Prince will doom thee death\r\nIf thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nO, I am fortune’s fool!\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nWhy dost thou stay?\r\n\r\n [_Exit Romeo._]\r\n\r\n Enter Citizens.\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nWhich way ran he that kill’d Mercutio?\r\nTybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nThere lies that Tybalt.\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nUp, sir, go with me.\r\nI charge thee in the Prince’s name obey.\r\n\r\n Enter Prince, attended; Montague, Capulet, their Wives and others.\r\n\r\nPRINCE.\r\nWhere are the vile beginners of this fray?\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nO noble Prince, I can discover all\r\nThe unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.\r\nThere lies the man, slain by young Romeo,\r\nThat slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nTybalt, my cousin! O my brother’s child!\r\nO Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill’d\r\nOf my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,\r\nFor blood of ours shed blood of Montague.\r\nO cousin, cousin.\r\n\r\nPRINCE.\r\nBenvolio, who began this bloody fray?\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nTybalt, here slain, whom Romeo’s hand did slay;\r\nRomeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink\r\nHow nice the quarrel was, and urg’d withal\r\nYour high displeasure. All this uttered\r\nWith gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow’d\r\nCould not take truce with the unruly spleen\r\nOf Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts\r\nWith piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,\r\nWho, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,\r\nAnd, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats\r\nCold death aside, and with the other sends\r\nIt back to Tybalt, whose dexterity\r\nRetorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,\r\n‘Hold, friends! Friends, part!’ and swifter than his tongue,\r\nHis agile arm beats down their fatal points,\r\nAnd ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm\r\nAn envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life\r\nOf stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.\r\nBut by and by comes back to Romeo,\r\nWho had but newly entertain’d revenge,\r\nAnd to’t they go like lightning; for, ere I\r\nCould draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain;\r\nAnd as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.\r\nThis is the truth, or let Benvolio die.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nHe is a kinsman to the Montague.\r\nAffection makes him false, he speaks not true.\r\nSome twenty of them fought in this black strife,\r\nAnd all those twenty could but kill one life.\r\nI beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give;\r\nRomeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.\r\n\r\nPRINCE.\r\nRomeo slew him, he slew Mercutio.\r\nWho now the price of his dear blood doth owe?\r\n\r\nMONTAGUE.\r\nNot Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio’s friend;\r\nHis fault concludes but what the law should end,\r\nThe life of Tybalt.\r\n\r\nPRINCE.\r\nAnd for that offence\r\nImmediately we do exile him hence.\r\nI have an interest in your hate’s proceeding,\r\nMy blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.\r\nBut I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine\r\nThat you shall all repent the loss of mine.\r\nI will be deaf to pleading and excuses;\r\nNor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.\r\nTherefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,\r\nElse, when he is found, that hour is his last.\r\nBear hence this body, and attend our will.\r\nMercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. A Room in Capulet’s House.\r\n\r\n Enter Juliet.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nGallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,\r\nTowards Phoebus’ lodging. Such a waggoner\r\nAs Phaeton would whip you to the west\r\nAnd bring in cloudy night immediately.\r\nSpread thy close curtain, love-performing night,\r\nThat runaway’s eyes may wink, and Romeo\r\nLeap to these arms, untalk’d of and unseen.\r\nLovers can see to do their amorous rites\r\nBy their own beauties: or, if love be blind,\r\nIt best agrees with night. Come, civil night,\r\nThou sober-suited matron, all in black,\r\nAnd learn me how to lose a winning match,\r\nPlay’d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.\r\nHood my unmann’d blood, bating in my cheeks,\r\nWith thy black mantle, till strange love, grow bold,\r\nThink true love acted simple modesty.\r\nCome, night, come Romeo; come, thou day in night;\r\nFor thou wilt lie upon the wings of night\r\nWhiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.\r\nCome gentle night, come loving black-brow’d night,\r\nGive me my Romeo, and when I shall die,\r\nTake him and cut him out in little stars,\r\nAnd he will make the face of heaven so fine\r\nThat all the world will be in love with night,\r\nAnd pay no worship to the garish sun.\r\nO, I have bought the mansion of a love,\r\nBut not possess’d it; and though I am sold,\r\nNot yet enjoy’d. So tedious is this day\r\nAs is the night before some festival\r\nTo an impatient child that hath new robes\r\nAnd may not wear them. O, here comes my Nurse,\r\nAnd she brings news, and every tongue that speaks\r\nBut Romeo’s name speaks heavenly eloquence.\r\n\r\n Enter Nurse, with cords.\r\n\r\nNow, Nurse, what news? What hast thou there?\r\nThe cords that Romeo bid thee fetch?\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nAy, ay, the cords.\r\n\r\n [_Throws them down._]\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nAy me, what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands?\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nAh, well-a-day, he’s dead, he’s dead, he’s dead!\r\nWe are undone, lady, we are undone.\r\nAlack the day, he’s gone, he’s kill’d, he’s dead.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nCan heaven be so envious?\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nRomeo can,\r\nThough heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo.\r\nWho ever would have thought it? Romeo!\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nWhat devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?\r\nThis torture should be roar’d in dismal hell.\r\nHath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but Ay,\r\nAnd that bare vowel I shall poison more\r\nThan the death-darting eye of cockatrice.\r\nI am not I if there be such an I;\r\nOr those eyes shut that make thee answer Ay.\r\nIf he be slain, say Ay; or if not, No.\r\nBrief sounds determine of my weal or woe.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nI saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,\r\nGod save the mark!—here on his manly breast.\r\nA piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;\r\nPale, pale as ashes, all bedaub’d in blood,\r\nAll in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nO, break, my heart. Poor bankrout, break at once.\r\nTo prison, eyes; ne’er look on liberty.\r\nVile earth to earth resign; end motion here,\r\nAnd thou and Romeo press one heavy bier.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nO Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had.\r\nO courteous Tybalt, honest gentleman!\r\nThat ever I should live to see thee dead.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nWhat storm is this that blows so contrary?\r\nIs Romeo slaughter’d and is Tybalt dead?\r\nMy dearest cousin, and my dearer lord?\r\nThen dreadful trumpet sound the general doom,\r\nFor who is living, if those two are gone?\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nTybalt is gone, and Romeo banished,\r\nRomeo that kill’d him, he is banished.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nO God! Did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nIt did, it did; alas the day, it did.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nO serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!\r\nDid ever dragon keep so fair a cave?\r\nBeautiful tyrant, fiend angelical,\r\nDove-feather’d raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!\r\nDespised substance of divinest show!\r\nJust opposite to what thou justly seem’st,\r\nA damned saint, an honourable villain!\r\nO nature, what hadst thou to do in hell\r\nWhen thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend\r\nIn mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?\r\nWas ever book containing such vile matter\r\nSo fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell\r\nIn such a gorgeous palace.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nThere’s no trust,\r\nNo faith, no honesty in men. All perjur’d,\r\nAll forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.\r\nAh, where’s my man? Give me some aqua vitae.\r\nThese griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.\r\nShame come to Romeo.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nBlister’d be thy tongue\r\nFor such a wish! He was not born to shame.\r\nUpon his brow shame is asham’d to sit;\r\nFor ’tis a throne where honour may be crown’d\r\nSole monarch of the universal earth.\r\nO, what a beast was I to chide at him!\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nWill you speak well of him that kill’d your cousin?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nShall I speak ill of him that is my husband?\r\nAh, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,\r\nWhen I thy three-hours’ wife have mangled it?\r\nBut wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?\r\nThat villain cousin would have kill’d my husband.\r\nBack, foolish tears, back to your native spring,\r\nYour tributary drops belong to woe,\r\nWhich you mistaking offer up to joy.\r\nMy husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain,\r\nAnd Tybalt’s dead, that would have slain my husband.\r\nAll this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?\r\nSome word there was, worser than Tybalt’s death,\r\nThat murder’d me. I would forget it fain,\r\nBut O, it presses to my memory\r\nLike damned guilty deeds to sinners’ minds.\r\nTybalt is dead, and Romeo banished.\r\nThat ‘banished,’ that one word ‘banished,’\r\nHath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt’s death\r\nWas woe enough, if it had ended there.\r\nOr if sour woe delights in fellowship,\r\nAnd needly will be rank’d with other griefs,\r\nWhy follow’d not, when she said Tybalt’s dead,\r\nThy father or thy mother, nay or both,\r\nWhich modern lamentation might have mov’d?\r\nBut with a rear-ward following Tybalt’s death,\r\n‘Romeo is banished’—to speak that word\r\nIs father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,\r\nAll slain, all dead. Romeo is banished,\r\nThere is no end, no limit, measure, bound,\r\nIn that word’s death, no words can that woe sound.\r\nWhere is my father and my mother, Nurse?\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nWeeping and wailing over Tybalt’s corse.\r\nWill you go to them? I will bring you thither.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nWash they his wounds with tears. Mine shall be spent,\r\nWhen theirs are dry, for Romeo’s banishment.\r\nTake up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil’d,\r\nBoth you and I; for Romeo is exil’d.\r\nHe made you for a highway to my bed,\r\nBut I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.\r\nCome cords, come Nurse, I’ll to my wedding bed,\r\nAnd death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nHie to your chamber. I’ll find Romeo\r\nTo comfort you. I wot well where he is.\r\nHark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.\r\nI’ll to him, he is hid at Lawrence’ cell.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nO find him, give this ring to my true knight,\r\nAnd bid him come to take his last farewell.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III. Friar Lawrence’s cell.\r\n\r\n Enter Friar Lawrence.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nRomeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.\r\nAffliction is enanmour’d of thy parts\r\nAnd thou art wedded to calamity.\r\n\r\n Enter Romeo.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nFather, what news? What is the Prince’s doom?\r\nWhat sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,\r\nThat I yet know not?\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nToo familiar\r\nIs my dear son with such sour company.\r\nI bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nWhat less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom?\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nA gentler judgment vanish’d from his lips,\r\nNot body’s death, but body’s banishment.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nHa, banishment? Be merciful, say death;\r\nFor exile hath more terror in his look,\r\nMuch more than death. Do not say banishment.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nHence from Verona art thou banished.\r\nBe patient, for the world is broad and wide.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nThere is no world without Verona walls,\r\nBut purgatory, torture, hell itself.\r\nHence banished is banish’d from the world,\r\nAnd world’s exile is death. Then banished\r\nIs death misterm’d. Calling death banished,\r\nThou cutt’st my head off with a golden axe,\r\nAnd smilest upon the stroke that murders me.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nO deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness!\r\nThy fault our law calls death, but the kind Prince,\r\nTaking thy part, hath brush’d aside the law,\r\nAnd turn’d that black word death to banishment.\r\nThis is dear mercy, and thou see’st it not.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\n’Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here\r\nWhere Juliet lives, and every cat and dog,\r\nAnd little mouse, every unworthy thing,\r\nLive here in heaven and may look on her,\r\nBut Romeo may not. More validity,\r\nMore honourable state, more courtship lives\r\nIn carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize\r\nOn the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand,\r\nAnd steal immortal blessing from her lips,\r\nWho, even in pure and vestal modesty\r\nStill blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.\r\nBut Romeo may not, he is banished.\r\nThis may flies do, when I from this must fly.\r\nThey are free men but I am banished.\r\nAnd say’st thou yet that exile is not death?\r\nHadst thou no poison mix’d, no sharp-ground knife,\r\nNo sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,\r\nBut banished to kill me? Banished?\r\nO Friar, the damned use that word in hell.\r\nHowling attends it. How hast thou the heart,\r\nBeing a divine, a ghostly confessor,\r\nA sin-absolver, and my friend profess’d,\r\nTo mangle me with that word banished?\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nThou fond mad man, hear me speak a little,\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nO, thou wilt speak again of banishment.\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nI’ll give thee armour to keep off that word,\r\nAdversity’s sweet milk, philosophy,\r\nTo comfort thee, though thou art banished.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nYet banished?

O woeful sympathy!\r\nPiteous predicament. Even so lies she,\r\nBlubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.\r\nStand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man.\r\nFor Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand.\r\nWhy should you fall into so deep an O?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nNurse.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nAh sir, ah sir, death’s the end of all.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nSpakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?\r\nDoth not she think me an old murderer,\r\nNow I have stain’d the childhood of our joy\r\nWith blood remov’d but little from her own?\r\nWhere is she? And how doth she? And what says\r\nMy conceal’d lady to our cancell’d love?\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nO, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;\r\nAnd now falls on her bed, and then starts up,\r\nAnd Tybalt calls, and then on Romeo cries,\r\nAnd then down falls again.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAs if that name,\r\nShot from the deadly level of a gun,\r\nDid murder her, as that name’s cursed hand\r\nMurder’d her kinsman. O, tell me, Friar, tell me,\r\nIn what vile part of this anatomy\r\nDoth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack\r\nThe hateful mansion.\r\n\r\n [_Drawing his sword._]\r\n\r\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\r\nHold thy desperate hand.\r\nArt thou a man?

By my holy order,\r\nI thought thy disposition better temper’d.\r\nHast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?\r\nAnd slay thy lady, that in thy life lives,\r\nBy doing damned hate upon thyself?\r\nWhy rail’st thou on thy birth, the heaven and earth?\r\nSince birth, and heaven and earth, all three do meet\r\nIn thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.\r\nFie, fie, thou sham’st thy shape, thy love, thy wit,\r\nWhich, like a usurer, abound’st in all,\r\nAnd usest none in that true use indeed\r\nWhich should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.\r\nThy noble shape is but a form of wax,\r\nDigressing from the valour of a man;\r\nThy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,\r\nKilling that love which thou hast vow’d to cherish;\r\nThy wit, that ornament to shape and love,\r\nMisshapen in the conduct of them both,\r\nLike powder in a skilless soldier’s flask,\r\nIs set afire by thine own ignorance,\r\nAnd thou dismember’d with thine own defence.\r\nWhat, rouse thee, man.

Well, we were born to die.\r\n’Tis very late; she’ll not come down tonight.\r\nI promise you, but for your company,\r\nI would have been abed an hour ago.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nThese times of woe afford no tune to woo.\r\nMadam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nI will, and know her mind early tomorrow;\r\nTonight she’s mew’d up to her heaviness.\r\n\r\nCAPULET.\r\nSir Paris, I will make a desperate tender\r\nOf my child’s love. I think she will be rul’d\r\nIn all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.\r\nWife, go you to her ere you go to bed,\r\nAcquaint her here of my son Paris’ love,\r\nAnd bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next,\r\nBut, soft, what day is this?\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nMonday, my lord.\r\n\r\nCAPULET.\r\nMonday! Ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,\r\nA Thursday let it be; a Thursday, tell her,\r\nShe shall be married to this noble earl.\r\nWill you be ready? Do you like this haste?\r\nWe’ll keep no great ado,—a friend or two,\r\nFor, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,\r\nIt may be thought we held him carelessly,\r\nBeing our kinsman, if we revel much.\r\nTherefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends,\r\nAnd there an end. But what say you to Thursday?\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nMy lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow.\r\n\r\nCAPULET.\r\nWell, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.\r\nGo you to Juliet ere you go to bed,\r\nPrepare her, wife, against this wedding day.\r\nFarewell, my lord.—Light to my chamber, ho!\r\nAfore me, it is so very very late that we\r\nMay call it early by and by. Good night.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE V. An open Gallery to Juliet’s Chamber, overlooking the Garden.\r\n\r\n Enter Romeo and Juliet.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nWilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.\r\nIt was the nightingale, and not the lark,\r\nThat pierc’d the fearful hollow of thine ear;\r\nNightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.\r\nBelieve me, love, it was the nightingale.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nIt was the lark, the herald of the morn,\r\nNo nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks\r\nDo lace the severing clouds in yonder east.\r\nNight’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day\r\nStands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.\r\nI must be gone and live, or stay and die.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nYond light is not daylight, I know it, I.\r\nIt is some meteor that the sun exhales\r\nTo be to thee this night a torchbearer\r\nAnd light thee on thy way to Mantua.\r\nTherefore stay yet, thou need’st not to be gone.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nLet me be ta’en, let me be put to death,\r\nI am content, so thou wilt have it so.\r\nI’ll say yon grey is not the morning’s eye,\r\n’Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia’s brow.\r\nNor that is not the lark whose notes do beat\r\nThe vaulty heaven so high above our heads.\r\nI have more care to stay than will to go.\r\nCome, death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so.\r\nHow is’t, my soul? Let’s talk. It is not day.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nIt is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away.\r\nIt is the lark that sings so out of tune,\r\nStraining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.\r\nSome say the lark makes sweet division;\r\nThis doth not so, for she divideth us.\r\nSome say the lark and loathed toad change eyes.\r\nO, now I would they had chang’d voices too,\r\nSince arm from arm that voice doth us affray,\r\nHunting thee hence with hunt’s-up to the day.\r\nO now be gone, more light and light it grows.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nMore light and light, more dark and dark our woes.\r\n\r\n Enter Nurse.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nMadam.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nNurse?\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nYour lady mother is coming to your chamber.\r\nThe day is broke, be wary, look about.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nThen, window, let day in, and let life out.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nFarewell, farewell, one kiss, and I’ll descend.\r\n\r\n [_Descends._]\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nArt thou gone so? Love, lord, ay husband, friend,\r\nI must hear from thee every day in the hour,\r\nFor in a minute there are many days.\r\nO, by this count I shall be much in years\r\nEre I again behold my Romeo.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nFarewell!\r\nI will omit no opportunity\r\nThat may convey my greetings, love, to thee.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nO thinkest thou we shall ever meet again?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI doubt it not, and all these woes shall serve\r\nFor sweet discourses in our time to come.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nO God! I have an ill-divining soul!\r\nMethinks I see thee, now thou art so low,\r\nAs one dead in the bottom of a tomb.\r\nEither my eyesight fails, or thou look’st pale.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAnd trust me, love, in my eye so do you.\r\nDry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu.\r\n\r\n [_Exit below._]\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nO Fortune, Fortune! All men call thee fickle,\r\nIf thou art fickle, what dost thou with him\r\nThat is renown’d for faith? Be fickle, Fortune;\r\nFor then, I hope thou wilt not keep him long\r\nBut send him back.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\n[_Within._] Ho, daughter, are you up?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nWho is’t that calls? Is it my lady mother?\r\nIs she not down so late, or up so early?\r\nWhat unaccustom’d cause procures her hither?\r\n\r\n Enter Lady Capulet.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nWhy, how now, Juliet?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nMadam, I am not well.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nEvermore weeping for your cousin’s death?\r\nWhat, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?\r\nAnd if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.\r\nTherefore have done: some grief shows much of love,\r\nBut much of grief shows still some want of wit.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nYet let me weep for such a feeling loss.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nSo shall you feel the loss, but not the friend\r\nWhich you weep for.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nFeeling so the loss,\r\nI cannot choose but ever weep the friend.\r\n"

There is much more difference as\r\nto their best work than in the case of those others who are loved “by\r\nallowance” by convention, and because it is felt to be the right and\r\nproper thing to love them. And in the sect--fairly large and yet\r\nunusually choice--of Austenians or Janites, there would probably be\r\nfound partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the\r\nnovels. To some the delightful freshness and humour of_ Northanger\r\nAbbey, _its completeness, finish, and_ entrain, _obscure the undoubted\r\ncritical facts that its scale is small, and its scheme, after all, that\r\nof burlesque or parody, a kind in which the first rank is reached with\r\ndifficulty._ Persuasion, _relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling\r\nin interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite\r\ndelicacy and keeping. The catastrophe of_ Mansfield Park _is admittedly\r\ntheatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost\r\nwickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that\r\nEdmund only took Fanny because Mary shocked him, and that Fanny might\r\nvery likely have taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous;\r\nyet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of Mrs. Norris and\r\nothers have secured, I believe, a considerable party for it._ Sense and\r\nSensibility _has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does\r\nnot want them._\r\n\r\n_I suppose, however, that the majority of at least competent votes\r\nwould, all things considered, be divided between_ Emma _and the present\r\nbook; and perhaps the vulgar verdict (if indeed a fondness for Miss\r\nAusten be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible charge\r\nof vulgarity) would go for_ Emma. _It is the larger, the more varied, the\r\nmore popular; the author had by the time of its composition seen rather\r\nmore of the world, and had improved her general, though not her most\r\npeculiar and characteristic dialogue; such figures as Miss Bates, as the\r\nEltons, cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody. On the other hand,\r\nI, for my part, declare for_ Pride and Prejudice _unhesitatingly. It\r\nseems to me the most perfect, the most characteristic, the most\r\neminently quintessential of its author’s works; and for this contention\r\nin such narrow space as is permitted to me, I propose here to show\r\ncause._\r\n\r\n_In the first place, the book (it may be barely necessary to remind the\r\nreader) was in its first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796,\r\nwhen Miss Austen was barely twenty-one; though it was revised and\r\nfinished at Chawton some fifteen years later, and was not published till\r\n1813, only four years before her death. I do not know whether, in this\r\ncombination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth, and the\r\ncritical revision of middle life, there may be traced the distinct\r\nsuperiority in point of construction, which, as it seems to me, it\r\npossesses over all the others. The plot, though not elaborate, is almost\r\nregular enough for Fielding; hardly a character, hardly an incident\r\ncould be retrenched without loss to the story. The elopement of Lydia\r\nand Wickham is not, like that of Crawford and Mrs. Rushworth, a_ coup de\r\nthéâtre; _it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the\r\nstory earlier, and brings about the denouement with complete propriety.\r\nAll the minor passages--the loves of Jane and Bingley, the advent of Mr.\r\nCollins, the visit to Hunsford, the Derbyshire tour--fit in after the\r\nsame unostentatious, but masterly fashion. There is no attempt at the\r\nhide-and-seek, in-and-out business, which in the transactions between\r\nFrank Churchill and Jane Fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to the\r\nintrigue of_ Emma, _but contributes it in a fashion which I do not think\r\nthe best feature of that otherwise admirable book. Although Miss Austen\r\nalways liked something of the misunderstanding kind, which afforded her\r\nopportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to\r\nbe noticed presently, she has been satisfied here with the perfectly\r\nnatural occasions provided by the false account of Darcy’s conduct given\r\nby Wickham, and by the awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness) from\r\nthe gradual transformation of Elizabeth’s own feelings from positive\r\naversion to actual love. I do not know whether the all-grasping hand of\r\nthe playwright has ever been laid upon_ Pride and Prejudice; _and I dare\r\nsay that, if it were, the situations would prove not startling or\r\ngarish enough for the footlights, the character-scheme too subtle and\r\ndelicate for pit and gallery. But if the attempt were made, it would\r\ncertainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction,\r\nwhich, sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist can\r\navail himself, appear at once on the stage._\r\n\r\n_I think, however, though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to\r\nmore than one school of critics, that construction is not the highest\r\nmerit, the choicest gift, of the novelist. It sets off his other gifts\r\nand graces most advantageously to the critical eye; and the want of it\r\nwill sometimes mar those graces--appreciably, though not quite\r\nconsciously--to eyes by no means ultra-critical. But a very badly-built\r\nnovel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character, or which\r\ndisplayed consummate command of dialogue--perhaps the rarest of all\r\nfaculties--would be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plot\r\nacted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths. And despite the\r\nability which Miss Austen has shown in working out the story, I for one\r\nshould put_ Pride and Prejudice _far lower if it did not contain what\r\nseem to me the very masterpieces of Miss Austen’s humour and of her\r\nfaculty of character-creation--masterpieces who may indeed admit John\r\nThorpe, the Eltons, Mrs. Norris, and one or two others to their company,\r\nbut who, in one instance certainly, and perhaps in others, are still\r\nsuperior to them._\r\n\r\n_The characteristics of Miss Austen’s humour are so subtle and delicate\r\nthat they are, perhaps, at all times easier to apprehend than to\r\nexpress, and at any particular time likely to be differently\r\napprehended by different persons. To me this humour seems to possess a\r\ngreater affinity, on the whole, to that of Addison than to any other of\r\nthe numerous species of this great British genus. The differences of\r\nscheme, of time, of subject, of literary convention, are, of course,\r\nobvious enough; the difference of sex does not, perhaps, count for much,\r\nfor there was a distinctly feminine element in “Mr. Spectator,” and in\r\nJane Austen’s genius there was, though nothing mannish, much that was\r\nmasculine. But the likeness of quality consists in a great number of\r\ncommon subdivisions of quality--demureness, extreme minuteness of touch,\r\navoidance of loud tones and glaring effects. Also there is in both a\r\ncertain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty. It is the custom with those\r\nwho judge grossly to contrast the good nature of Addison with the\r\nsavagery of Swift, the mildness of Miss Austen with the boisterousness\r\nof Fielding and Smollett, even with the ferocious practical jokes that\r\nher immediate predecessor, Miss Burney, allowed without very much\r\nprotest. Yet, both in Mr. Addison and in Miss Austen there is, though a\r\nrestrained and well-mannered, an insatiable and ruthless delight in\r\nroasting and cutting up a fool. A man in the early eighteenth century,\r\nof course, could push this taste further than a lady in the early\r\nnineteenth; and no doubt Miss Austen’s principles, as well as her heart,\r\nwould have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate\r\nhusband in the_ Spectator, _who describes, with all the gusto and all the\r\ninnocence in the world, how his wife and his friend induce him to play\r\nat blind-man’s-buff. But another_ Spectator _letter--that of the damsel\r\nof fourteen who wishes to marry Mr. Shapely, and assures her selected\r\nMentor that “he admires your_ Spectators _mightily”--might have been\r\nwritten by a rather more ladylike and intelligent Lydia Bennet in the\r\ndays of Lydia’s great-grandmother; while, on the other hand, some (I\r\nthink unreasonably) have found “cynicism” in touches of Miss Austen’s\r\nown, such as her satire of Mrs. Musgrove’s self-deceiving regrets over\r\nher son. But this word “cynical” is one of the most misused in the\r\nEnglish language, especially when, by a glaring and gratuitous\r\nfalsification of its original sense, it is applied, not to rough and\r\nsnarling invective, but to gentle and oblique satire. If cynicism means\r\nthe perception of “the other side,” the sense of “the accepted hells\r\nbeneath,” the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed, and\r\nthat to seem is not identical with to be--if this be cynicism, then\r\nevery man and woman who is not a fool, who does not care to live in a\r\nfool’s paradise, who has knowledge of nature and the world and life, is\r\na cynic. And in that sense Miss Austen certainly was one. She may even\r\nhave been one in the further sense that, like her own Mr. Bennet, she\r\ntook an epicurean delight in dissecting, in displaying, in setting at\r\nwork her fools and her mean persons. I think she did take this delight,\r\nand I do not think at all the worse of her for it as a woman, while she\r\nwas immensely the better for it as an artist._\r\n\r\n_In respect of her art generally, Mr. Goldwin Smith has truly observed\r\nthat “metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it,\r\ncombined with the narrowness of her field;” and he has justly added that\r\nwe need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of a miniature\r\npainter. To make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the\r\nterm miniature in its restricted sense, and must think rather of Memling\r\nat one end of the history of painting and Meissonier at the other, than\r\nof Cosway or any of his kind. And I am not so certain that I should\r\nmyself use the word “narrow” in connection with her. If her world is a\r\nmicrocosm, the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the\r\nlittleness. She does not touch what she did not feel herself called to\r\npaint; I am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not\r\nfeel herself called to touch. It is at least remarkable that in two very\r\nshort periods of writing--one of about three years, and another of not\r\nmuch more than five--she executed six capital works, and has not left a\r\nsingle failure. It is possible that the romantic paste in her\r\ncomposition was defective: we must always remember that hardly\r\nanybody born in her decade--that of the eighteenth-century\r\nseventies--independently exhibited the full romantic quality. Even Scott\r\nrequired hill and mountain and ballad, even Coleridge metaphysics and\r\nGerman to enable them to chip the classical shell. Miss Austen was an\r\nEnglish girl, brought up in a country retirement, at the time when\r\nladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which might\r\npierce their kid shoes, when a sudden cold was the subject of the\r\ngravest fears, when their studies, their ways, their conduct were\r\nsubject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against which\r\nMary Wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particular\r\ntaste or judgment. Miss Austen, too, drew back when the white frost\r\ntouched her shoes; but I think she would have made a pretty good journey\r\neven in a black one._\r\n\r\n_For if her knowledge was not very extended, she knew two things which\r\nonly genius knows. The one was humanity, and the other was art. On the\r\nfirst head she could not make a mistake; her men, though limited, are\r\ntrue, and her women are, in the old sense, “absolute.” As to art, if she\r\nhas never tried idealism, her realism is real to a degree which makes\r\nthe false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive. Take almost any\r\nFrenchman, except the late M. de Maupassant, and watch him laboriously\r\npiling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression. You get\r\nnone; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what he gives, you can\r\nshape a real impression out of the rest. But with Miss Austen the\r\nmyriad, trivial, unforced strokes build up the picture like magic.\r\nNothing is false; nothing is superfluous. When (to take the present book\r\nonly) Mr. Collins changed his mind from Jane to Elizabeth “while Mrs.\r\nBennet was stirring the fire” (and we know_ how _Mrs. Bennet would have\r\nstirred the fire), when Mr. Darcy “brought his coffee-cup back_\r\nhimself,” _the touch in each case is like that of Swift--“taller by the\r\nbreadth of my nail”--which impressed the half-reluctant Thackeray with\r\njust and outspoken admiration. Indeed, fantastic as it may seem, I\r\nshould put Miss Austen as near to Swift in some ways, as I have put her\r\nto Addison in others._\r\n\r\n_This Swiftian quality appears in the present novel as it appears\r\nnowhere else in the character of the immortal, the ineffable Mr.\r\nCollins. Mr. Collins is really_ great; _far greater than anything Addison\r\never did, almost great enough for Fielding or for Swift himself. It has\r\nbeen said that no one ever was like him. But in the first place,_ he\r\n_was like him; he is there--alive, imperishable, more real than hundreds\r\nof prime ministers and archbishops, of “metals, semi-metals, and\r\ndistinguished philosophers.” In the second place, it is rash, I think,\r\nto conclude that an actual Mr. Collins was impossible or non-existent at\r\nthe end of the eighteenth century. It is very interesting that we\r\npossess, in this same gallery, what may be called a spoiled first\r\ndraught, or an unsuccessful study of him, in John Dashwood. The\r\nformality, the under-breeding, the meanness, are there; but the portrait\r\nis only half alive, and is felt to be even a little unnatural. Mr.\r\nCollins is perfectly natural, and perfectly alive. In fact, for all the\r\n“miniature,” there is something gigantic in the way in which a certain\r\nside, and more than one, of humanity, and especially eighteenth-century\r\nhumanity, its Philistinism, its well-meaning but hide-bound morality,\r\nits formal pettiness, its grovelling respect for rank, its materialism,\r\nits selfishness, receives exhibition. I will not admit that one speech\r\nor one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being reconciled\r\nwith reality, and I should not wonder if many of these words and actions\r\nare historically true._\r\n\r\n_But the greatness of Mr. Collins could not have been so satisfactorily\r\nexhibited if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him the\r\nfigures of Mr. Bennet and of Lady Catherine de Bourgh. The latter, like\r\nMr. Collins himself, has been charged with exaggeration. There is,\r\nperhaps, a very faint shade of colour for the charge; but it seems to me\r\nvery faint indeed. Even now I do not think that it would be impossible\r\nto find persons, especially female persons, not necessarily of noble\r\nbirth, as overbearing, as self-centred, as neglectful of good manners,\r\nas Lady Catherine. A hundred years ago, an earl’s daughter, the Lady\r\nPowerful (if not exactly Bountiful) of an out-of-the-way country parish,\r\nrich, long out of marital authority, and so forth, had opportunities of\r\ndeveloping these agreeable characteristics which seldom present\r\nthemselves now. As for Mr. Bennet, Miss Austen, and Mr. Darcy, and even\r\nMiss Elizabeth herself, were, I am inclined to think, rather hard on him\r\nfor the “impropriety” of his conduct. His wife was evidently, and must\r\nalways have been, a quite irreclaimable fool; and unless he had shot her\r\nor himself there was no way out of it for a man of sense and spirit but\r\nthe ironic. From no other point of view is he open to any reproach,\r\nexcept for an excusable and not unnatural helplessness at the crisis of\r\nthe elopement, and his utterances are the most acutely delightful in the\r\nconsciously humorous kind--in the kind that we laugh with, not at--that\r\neven Miss Austen has put into the mouth of any of her characters. It is\r\ndifficult to know whether he is most agreeable when talking to his wife,\r\nor when putting Mr. Collins through his paces; but the general sense of\r\nthe world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank his\r\nconsolation to the former when she maunders over the entail, “My dear,\r\ndo not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things.\r\nLet us flatter ourselves that_ I _may be the survivor;” and his inquiry\r\nto his colossal cousin as to the compliments which Mr. Collins has just\r\nrelated as made by himself to Lady Catherine, “May I ask whether these\r\npleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the\r\nresult of previous study?” These are the things which give Miss Austen’s\r\nreaders the pleasant shocks, the delightful thrills, which are felt by\r\nthe readers of Swift, of Fielding, and we may here add, of Thackeray, as\r\nthey are felt by the readers of no other English author of fiction\r\noutside of these four._\r\n\r\n_The goodness of the minor characters in_ Pride and Prejudice _has been\r\nalready alluded to, and it makes a detailed dwelling on their beauties\r\ndifficult in any space, and impossible in this. Mrs. Bennet we have\r\nglanced at, and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitely\r\namusing or more horribly true. Much the same may be said of Kitty and\r\nLydia; but it is not every author, even of genius, who would have\r\ndifferentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly and\r\nvulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the common\r\nweaknesses of woman at such different ages. With Mary, Miss Austen has\r\ntaken rather less pains, though she has been even more unkind to her;\r\nnot merely in the text, but, as we learn from those interesting\r\ntraditional appendices which Mr. Austen Leigh has given us, in dooming\r\nher privately to marry “one of Mr. Philips’s clerks.” The habits of\r\nfirst copying and then retailing moral sentiments, of playing and\r\nsinging too long in public, are, no doubt, grievous and criminal; but\r\nperhaps poor Mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockings\r\nin that Fordyce-belectured generation. It is at any rate difficult not\r\nto extend to her a share of the respect and affection (affection and\r\nrespect of a peculiar kind; doubtless), with which one regards Mr.\r\nCollins, when she draws the moral of Lydia’s fall. I sometimes wish\r\nthat the exigencies of the story had permitted Miss Austen to unite\r\nthese personages, and thus at once achieve a notable mating and soothe\r\npoor Mrs. Bennet’s anguish over the entail._\r\n\r\n_The Bingleys and the Gardiners and the Lucases, Miss Darcy and Miss de\r\nBourgh, Jane, Wickham, and the rest, must pass without special comment,\r\nfurther than the remark that Charlotte Lucas (her egregious papa, though\r\ndelightful, is just a little on the thither side of the line between\r\ncomedy and farce) is a wonderfully clever study in drab of one kind, and\r\nthat Wickham (though something of Miss Austen’s hesitation of touch in\r\ndealing with young men appears) is a not much less notable sketch in\r\ndrab of another. Only genius could have made Charlotte what she is, yet\r\nnot disagreeable; Wickham what he is, without investing him either with\r\na cheap Don Juanish attractiveness or a disgusting rascality. But the\r\nhero and the heroine are not tints to be dismissed._\r\n\r\n_Darcy has always seemed to me by far the best and most interesting of\r\nMiss Austen’s heroes; the only possible competitor being Henry Tilney,\r\nwhose part is so slight and simple that it hardly enters into\r\ncomparison. It has sometimes, I believe, been urged that his pride is\r\nunnatural at first in its expression and later in its yielding, while\r\nhis falling in love at all is not extremely probable. Here again I\r\ncannot go with the objectors. Darcy’s own account of the way in which\r\nhis pride had been pampered, is perfectly rational and sufficient; and\r\nnothing could be, psychologically speaking, a_ causa verior _for its\r\nsudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of Elizabeth’s\r\nscornful refusal acting on a nature_ ex hypothesi _generous. Nothing in\r\neven our author is finer and more delicately touched than the change of\r\nhis demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of Pemberley. Had he\r\nbeen a bad prig or a bad coxcomb, he might have been still smarting\r\nunder his rejection, or suspicious that the girl had come\r\nhusband-hunting. His being neither is exactly consistent with the\r\nprobable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense, but not really\r\ninjured in disposition, and thoroughly in love. As for his being in\r\nlove, Elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of that\r\nphenomenon as Darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state,\r\nonly she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personal\r\ncharm._\r\n\r\n_The secret of that charm many men and not a few women, from Miss Austen\r\nherself downwards, have felt, and like most charms it is a thing rather\r\nto be felt than to be explained. Elizabeth of course belongs to the_\r\nallegro _or_ allegra _division of the army of Venus. Miss Austen was\r\nalways provokingly chary of description in regard to her beauties; and\r\nexcept the fine eyes, and a hint or two that she had at any rate\r\nsometimes a bright complexion, and was not very tall, we hear nothing\r\nabout her looks. But her chief difference from other heroines of the\r\nlively type seems to lie first in her being distinctly clever--almost\r\nstrong-minded, in the better sense of that objectionable word--and\r\nsecondly in her being entirely destitute of ill-nature for all her\r\npropensity to tease and the sharpness of her tongue. Elizabeth can give\r\nat least as good as she gets when she is attacked; but she never\r\n“scratches,” and she never attacks first. Some of the merest\r\nobsoletenesses of phrase and manner give one or two of her early\r\nspeeches a slight pertness, but that is nothing, and when she comes to\r\nserious business, as in the great proposal scene with Darcy (which is,\r\nas it should be, the climax of the interest of the book), and in the\r\nfinal ladies’ battle with Lady Catherine, she is unexceptionable. Then\r\ntoo she is a perfectly natural girl. She does not disguise from herself\r\nor anybody that she resents Darcy’s first ill-mannered personality with\r\nas personal a feeling. (By the way, the reproach that the ill-manners of\r\nthis speech are overdone is certainly unjust; for things of the same\r\nkind, expressed no doubt less stiltedly but more coarsely, might have\r\nbeen heard in more than one ball-room during this very year from persons\r\nwho ought to have been no worse bred than Darcy.) And she lets the\r\ninjury done to Jane and the contempt shown to the rest of her family\r\naggravate this resentment in the healthiest way in the world._\r\n\r\n_Still, all this does not explain her charm, which, taking beauty as a\r\ncommon form of all heroines, may perhaps consist in the addition to her\r\nplayfulness, her wit, her affectionate and natural disposition, of a\r\ncertain fearlessness very uncommon in heroines of her type and age.\r\nNearly all of them would have been in speechless awe of the magnificent\r\nDarcy; nearly all of them would have palpitated and fluttered at the\r\nidea of proposals, even naughty ones, from the fascinating Wickham.\r\nElizabeth, with nothing offensive, nothing_ viraginous, _nothing of the\r\n“New Woman” about her, has by nature what the best modern (not “new”)\r\nwomen have by education and experience, a perfect freedom from the idea\r\nthat all men may bully her if they choose, and that most will away with\r\nher if they can. Though not in the least “impudent and mannish grown,”\r\nshe has no mere sensibility, no nasty niceness about her. The form of\r\npassion common and likely to seem natural in Miss Austen’s day was so\r\ninvariably connected with the display of one or the other, or both of\r\nthese qualities, that she has not made Elizabeth outwardly passionate.\r\nBut I, at least, have not the slightest doubt that she would have\r\nmarried Darcy just as willingly without Pemberley as with it, and\r\nanybody who can read between lines will not find the lovers’\r\nconversations in the final chapters so frigid as they might have looked\r\nto the Della Cruscans of their own day, and perhaps do look to the Della\r\nCruscans of this._\r\n\r\n_And, after all, what is the good of seeking for the reason of\r\ncharm?--it is there. There were better sense in the sad mechanic\r\nexercise of determining the reason of its absence where it is not. In\r\nthe novels of the last hundred years there are vast numbers of young\r\nladies with whom it might be a pleasure to fall in love; there are at\r\nleast five with whom, as it seems to me, no man of taste and spirit can\r\nhelp doing so. Their names are, in chronological order, Elizabeth\r\nBennet, Diana Vernon, Argemone Lavington, Beatrix Esmond, and Barbara\r\nGrant. I should have been most in love with Beatrix and Argemone; I\r\nshould, I think, for mere occasional companionship, have preferred Diana\r\nand Barbara. But to live with and to marry, I do not know that any one\r\nof the four can come into competition with Elizabeth._\r\n\r\n_GEORGE SAINTSBURY._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: List of

 476\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ·PRIDE AND PREJUDICE·\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession\r\nof a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\r\n\r\nHowever little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his\r\nfirst entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds\r\nof the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful\r\nproperty of some one or other of their daughters.\r\n\r\n“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that\r\nNetherfield Park is let at last?”\r\n\r\nMr. Bennet replied that he had not.\r\n\r\n“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she\r\ntold me all about it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bennet made no answer.\r\n\r\n“Do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife, impatiently.\r\n\r\n“_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n“He came down to see the place”\r\n\r\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\r\n\r\nThis was invitation enough.\r\n\r\n“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken\r\nby a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came\r\ndown on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much\r\ndelighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is\r\nto take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be\r\nin the house by the end of next week.”\r\n\r\n“What is his name?”\r\n\r\n“Bingley.”\r\n\r\n“Is he married or single?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or\r\nfive thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”\r\n\r\n“How so? how can it affect them?”\r\n\r\n“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome? You\r\nmust know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”\r\n\r\n“Is that his design in settling here?”\r\n\r\n“Design? Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he\r\n_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as\r\nsoon as he comes.”\r\n\r\n“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go--or you may send\r\nthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are\r\nas handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the\r\nparty.”\r\n\r\n“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but\r\nI do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five\r\ngrown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”\r\n\r\n“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into\r\nthe neighbourhood.”\r\n\r\n“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”\r\n\r\n“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would\r\nbe for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,\r\nmerely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new\r\ncomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit\r\nhim, if you do not.”\r\n\r\n“You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very\r\nglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\r\nhearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls--though\r\nI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”\r\n\r\n“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the\r\nothers: and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\r\ngood-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.”\r\n\r\n“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he: “they are\r\nall silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of\r\nquickness than her sisters.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take\r\ndelight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.”\r\n\r\n“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They\r\nare my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration\r\nthese twenty years at least.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”\r\n\r\n“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\r\nthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”\r\n\r\n“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not\r\nvisit them.”\r\n\r\n“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them\r\nall.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\r\nreserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had\r\nbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind\r\nwas less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding,\r\nlittle information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she\r\nfancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her\r\ndaughters married: its solace was visiting and news.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: M^{r.} & M^{rs.} Bennet\r\n\r\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it”\r\n\r\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He\r\nhad always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his\r\nwife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was\r\npaid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following\r\nmanner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he\r\nsuddenly addressed her with,--\r\n\r\n“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”\r\n\r\n“We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother,\r\nresentfully, “since we are not to visit.”\r\n\r\n“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the\r\nassemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.”\r\n\r\n“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces\r\nof her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion\r\nof her.”\r\n\r\n“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do\r\nnot depend on her serving you.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain\r\nherself, began scolding one of her daughters.\r\n\r\n“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake! Have a little\r\ncompassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”\r\n\r\n“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times\r\nthem ill.”\r\n\r\n“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty, fretfully. “When\r\nis your next ball to be, Lizzy?”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow fortnight.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back till\r\nthe day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for\r\nshe will not know him herself.”\r\n\r\n“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce\r\nMr. Bingley to _her_.”\r\n\r\n“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him\r\nmyself; how can you be so teasing?”\r\n\r\n“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly\r\nvery little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a\r\nfortnight. But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after\r\nall, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore,\r\nas she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I\r\nwill take it on myself.”\r\n\r\nThe girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,\r\nnonsense!”\r\n\r\n“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do\r\nyou consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on\r\nthem, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,\r\nMary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read\r\ngreat books, and make extracts.”\r\n\r\nMary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.\r\n\r\n“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.\r\nBingley.”\r\n\r\n“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did you not tell me so before? If I\r\nhad known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on\r\nhim. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we\r\ncannot escape the acquaintance now.”\r\n\r\nThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished--that of Mrs.\r\nBennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy\r\nwas over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\n“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\r\npersuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to\r\nneglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! And it is such a\r\ngood joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a\r\nword about it till now.”\r\n\r\n“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and,\r\nas he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.\r\n\r\n“What an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the door was\r\nshut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;\r\nor me either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so\r\npleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but\r\nfor your sakes we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_\r\nthe youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next\r\nball.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Lydia, stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the\r\nyoungest, I’m the tallest.”\r\n\r\nThe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would\r\nreturn Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “I’m the tallest”]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     “He rode a black horse”\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNot all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five\r\ndaughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her\r\nhusband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him\r\nin various ways, with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and\r\ndistant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at\r\nlast obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,\r\nLady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been\r\ndelighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely\r\nagreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly\r\nwith a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of\r\ndancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively\r\nhopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.\r\n\r\n“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,”\r\nsaid Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well\r\nmarried, I shall have nothing to wish for.”\r\n\r\nIn a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat about ten\r\nminutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being\r\nadmitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard\r\nmuch; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more\r\nfortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upper\r\nwindow, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.\r\n\r\nAn invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched; and already had\r\nMrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her\r\nhousekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley\r\nwas obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to\r\naccept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite\r\ndisconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town\r\nso soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that\r\nhe might always be flying about from one place to another, and never\r\nsettled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a\r\nlittle by starting the idea of his\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     “When the Party entered”\r\n\r\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\r\n\r\nbeing gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a\r\nreport soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and\r\nseven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a\r\nnumber of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing\r\nthat, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London,\r\nhis five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the\r\nassembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: Mr. Bingley, his\r\ntwo sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.\r\n\r\nMr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant\r\ncountenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,\r\nwith an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely\r\nlooked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention\r\nof the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and\r\nthe report, which was in general circulation within five minutes after\r\nhis entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen\r\npronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was\r\nmuch handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great\r\nadmiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust\r\nwhich turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be\r\nproud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his\r\nlarge estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding,\r\ndisagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nMr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal\r\npeople in the room: he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,\r\nwas angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one\r\nhimself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for\r\nthemselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced\r\nonly once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being\r\nintroduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in\r\nwalking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.\r\nHis character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in\r\nthe world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.\r\nAmongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of\r\nhis general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his\r\nhaving slighted one of her daughters.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit\r\ndown for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been\r\nstanding near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and\r\nMr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his\r\nfriend to join it.\r\n\r\n“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you\r\nstanding about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better\r\ndance.”\r\n\r\n“I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am\r\nparticularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this, it\r\nwould be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not\r\nanother woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to\r\nstand up with.”\r\n\r\n“I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley, “for a\r\nkingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my\r\nlife as I have this evening; and there are several of them, you see,\r\nuncommonly pretty.”\r\n\r\n“_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr.\r\nDarcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\r\n\r\n“Oh, she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one\r\nof her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I\r\ndare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n“She is tolerable”\r\n\r\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\r\n\r\n“Which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at\r\nElizabeth, till, catching her eye, he withdrew his own, and coldly said,\r\n“She is tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no\r\nhumour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted\r\nby other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her\r\nsmiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth\r\nremained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story,\r\nhowever, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,\r\nplayful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.\r\n\r\nThe evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.\r\nBennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield\r\nparty. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been\r\ndistinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her\r\nmother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane’s\r\npleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most\r\naccomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\r\nfortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they\r\nhad yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good\r\nspirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they\r\nwere the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a\r\nbook, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a\r\ngood deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised\r\nsuch splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife’s\r\nviews on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he\r\nhad a very different story to hear.\r\n\r\n“Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most\r\ndelightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.\r\nJane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well\r\nshe looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with\r\nher twice. Only think of _that_, my dear: he actually danced with her\r\ntwice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second\r\ntime. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand\r\nup with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody\r\ncan, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\r\ndown the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and\r\nasked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss\r\nKing, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane\r\nagain, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_----”\r\n\r\n“If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,\r\n“he would not have danced half so much! For God’s sake, say no more of\r\nhis partners. O that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I am quite delighted with him. He\r\nis so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never\r\nin my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the\r\nlace upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown----”\r\n\r\nHere she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\r\ndescription of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch\r\nof the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and some\r\nexaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\r\n\r\n“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not\r\nsuiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at\r\nall worth pleasing. So high and so conceited, that there was no enduring\r\nhim! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very\r\ngreat! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my\r\ndear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in\r\nher praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much\r\nshe admired him.\r\n\r\n“He is just what a young-man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,\r\ngood-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! so much ease,\r\nwith such perfect good breeding!”\r\n\r\n“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought\r\nlikewise to be if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.”\r\n\r\n“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I\r\ndid not expect such a compliment.”\r\n\r\n“Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference between\r\nus. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What\r\ncould be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help\r\nseeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in\r\nthe room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is\r\nvery agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a\r\nstupider person.”\r\n\r\n“Dear Lizzy!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.\r\nYou never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable\r\nin your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.”\r\n\r\n“I would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak\r\nwhat I think.”\r\n\r\n“I know you do: and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_\r\ngood sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of\r\nothers! Affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it\r\neverywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the\r\ngood of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing\r\nof the bad,--belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man’s sisters,\r\ntoo, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when you\r\nconverse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep\r\nhis house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming\r\nneighbour in her.”\r\n\r\nElizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour at\r\nthe assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more\r\nquickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and\r\nwith a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was\r\nvery little disposed to approve them. They were, in fact, very fine\r\nladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the\r\npower of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.\r\nThey were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private\r\nseminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the\r\nhabit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people\r\nof rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of\r\nthemselves and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in\r\nthe north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their\r\nmemories than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been\r\nacquired by trade.\r\n\r\nMr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred\r\nthousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,\r\nbut did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and\r\nsometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with a\r\ngood house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those\r\nwho best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the\r\nremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to\r\npurchase.\r\n\r\nHis sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but\r\nthough he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no\r\nmeans unwilling to preside at his table; nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had\r\nmarried a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider\r\nhis house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of\r\nage two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to\r\nlook at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it, for half an\r\nhour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied\r\nwith what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.\r\n\r\nBetween him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a\r\ngreat opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the\r\neasiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition\r\ncould offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he\r\nnever appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley\r\nhad the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In\r\nunderstanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means\r\ndeficient; but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,\r\nreserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not\r\ninviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley\r\nwas sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continually\r\ngiving offence.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently\r\ncharacteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier\r\ngirls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him;\r\nthere had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted\r\nwith all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel\r\nmore beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people\r\nin whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had\r\nfelt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or\r\npleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired\r\nher and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom\r\nthey should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore\r\nestablished as a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such\r\ncommendation to think of her as he chose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWithin a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets\r\nwere particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade\r\nin Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the\r\nhonour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The\r\ndistinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. It had given him a\r\ndisgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town;\r\nand, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about\r\na mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge; where he\r\ncould think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by\r\nbusiness, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For,\r\nthough elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the\r\ncontrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive,\r\nfriendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James’s had made him\r\ncourteous.\r\n\r\nLady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a\r\nvaluable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest\r\nof them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was\r\nElizabeth’s intimate friend.\r\n\r\nThat the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a\r\nball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly\r\nbrought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.\r\n\r\n“_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet, with civil\r\nself-command, to Miss Lucas. “_You_ were Mr. Bingley’s first choice.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be\r\nsure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed, I rather believe he\r\n_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something\r\nabout Mr. Robinson.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson: did not\r\nI mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he liked our Meryton\r\nassemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty\r\nwomen in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his\r\nanswering immediately to the last question, ‘Oh, the eldest Miss Bennet,\r\nbeyond a doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point.’”\r\n\r\n“Upon my word! Well, that was very decided, indeed--that does seem as\r\nif--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”\r\n\r\n“_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,” said\r\nCharlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,\r\nis he? Poor Eliza! to be only just _tolerable_.”\r\n\r\n“I beg you will not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his\r\nill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite\r\na misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he\r\nsat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Without once opening his lips”\r\n\r\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\r\n\r\n“Are you quite sure, ma’am? Is not there a little mistake?” said Jane.\r\n“I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he\r\ncould not help answering her; but she said he seemed very angry at being\r\nspoke to.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much unless\r\namong his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is remarkably\r\nagreeable.”\r\n\r\n“I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very\r\nagreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it\r\nwas; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had\r\nheard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had to come\r\nto the ball in a hack chaise.”\r\n\r\n“I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I\r\nwish he had danced with Eliza.”\r\n\r\n“Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with _him_,\r\nif I were you.”\r\n\r\n“I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.”\r\n\r\n“His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as pride\r\noften does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so\r\nvery fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,\r\nshould think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_\r\nto be proud.”\r\n\r\n“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive\r\n_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”\r\n\r\n“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her\r\nreflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have\r\never read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human\r\nnature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us\r\nwho do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some\r\nquality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different\r\nthings, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be\r\nproud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of\r\nourselves; vanity to what we would have others think of us.”\r\n\r\n“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with his\r\nsisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of\r\nfoxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.”\r\n\r\n“Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs.\r\nBennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle\r\ndirectly.”\r\n\r\nThe boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she\r\nwould; and the argument ended only with the visit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit\r\nwas returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing manners grew on the\r\ngood-will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was\r\nfound to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,\r\na wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the\r\ntwo eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest\r\npleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of\r\neverybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;\r\nthough their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising,\r\nin all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration. It\r\nwas generally evident, whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and\r\nto _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference\r\nwhich she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a\r\nway to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it\r\nwas not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane\r\nunited with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and an\r\nuniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the\r\nsuspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend, Miss\r\nLucas.\r\n\r\n“It may, perhaps, be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose\r\non the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be\r\nso very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill\r\nfrom the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and\r\nit will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the\r\ndark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every\r\nattachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all\r\n_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are\r\nvery few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without\r\nencouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_\r\naffection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he\r\nmay never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”\r\n\r\n“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If _I_ can\r\nperceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to\r\ndiscover it too.”\r\n\r\n“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you do.”\r\n\r\n“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal\r\nit, he must find it out.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane\r\nmeet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they\r\nalways see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that\r\nevery moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should\r\ntherefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his\r\nattention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling\r\nin love as much as she chooses.”\r\n\r\n“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in\r\nquestion but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined\r\nto get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But\r\nthese are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet she\r\ncannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its\r\nreasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four\r\ndances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,\r\nand has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite\r\nenough to make her understand his character.”\r\n\r\n“Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might\r\nonly have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must\r\nremember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four\r\nevenings may do a great deal.”\r\n\r\n“Yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both\r\nlike Vingt-un better than Commerce, but with respect to any other\r\nleading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if\r\nshe were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a\r\nchance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a\r\ntwelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If\r\nthe dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or\r\never so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the\r\nleast. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to\r\nhave their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as\r\npossible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\n“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not\r\nsound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”\r\n\r\nOccupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attention to her sister, Elizabeth\r\nwas far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some\r\ninterest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely\r\nallowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the\r\nball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no\r\nsooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had\r\nhardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered\r\nuncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To\r\nthis discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had\r\ndetected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry\r\nin her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and\r\npleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those\r\nof the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of\r\nthis she was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who made\r\nhimself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough\r\nto dance with.\r\n\r\nHe began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversing\r\nwith her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so\r\ndrew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party were\r\nassembled.\r\n\r\n“What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my\r\nconversation with Colonel Forster?”\r\n\r\n“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”\r\n\r\n“But if he does it any more, I shall certainly let him know that I see\r\nwhat he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by\r\nbeing impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “The entreaties of several” [_Copyright 1894 by George\r\nAllen._]]\r\n\r\nOn his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have\r\nany intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such\r\na subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she\r\nturned to him and said,--\r\n\r\n“Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well\r\njust now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at\r\nMeryton?”\r\n\r\n“With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady\r\nenergetic.”\r\n\r\n“You are severe on us.”\r\n\r\n“It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am going\r\nto open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”\r\n\r\n“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me\r\nto play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a\r\nmusical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would\r\nreally rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of\r\nhearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas’s persevering, however,\r\nshe added, “Very well; if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing\r\nat Mr. Darcy, “There is a very fine old saying, which everybody here is\r\nof course familiar with--‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’--and\r\nI shall keep mine to swell my song.”\r\n\r\nHer performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song\r\nor two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she\r\nwould sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her\r\nsister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in\r\nthe family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always\r\nimpatient for display.\r\n\r\nMary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her\r\napplication, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited\r\nmanner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she\r\nhad reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with\r\nmuch more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the\r\nend of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by\r\nScotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with\r\nsome of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in\r\ndancing at one end of the room.\r\n\r\nMr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\r\npassing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too\r\nmuch engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas\r\nwas his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:--\r\n\r\n“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is\r\nnothing like dancing, after all. I consider it as one of the first\r\nrefinements of polished societies.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst\r\nthe less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.”\r\n\r\nSir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he\r\ncontinued, after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt\r\nnot that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”\r\n\r\n“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do\r\nyou often dance at St. James’s?”\r\n\r\n“Never, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”\r\n\r\n“It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”\r\n\r\n“You have a house in town, I conclude?”\r\n\r\nMr. Darcy bowed.\r\n\r\n“I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself, for I am fond of\r\nsuperior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of\r\nLondon would agree with Lady Lucas.”\r\n\r\nHe paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed to\r\nmake any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was\r\nstruck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to\r\nher,--\r\n\r\n“My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow\r\nme to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You\r\ncannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.”\r\nAnd, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though\r\nextremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly\r\ndrew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,--\r\n\r\n“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you\r\nnot to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”\r\n\r\nMr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of\r\nher hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at\r\nall shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.\r\n\r\n“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me\r\nthe happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the\r\namusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us\r\nfor one half hour.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.\r\n\r\n“He is, indeed: but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we\r\ncannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a\r\npartner?”\r\n\r\nElizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured\r\nher with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some\r\ncomplacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,--\r\n\r\n“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”\r\n\r\n“I should imagine not.”\r\n\r\n“You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many\r\nevenings in this manner,--in such society; and, indeed, I am quite of\r\nyour opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the\r\nnoise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all these\r\npeople! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”\r\n\r\n“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more\r\nagreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure\r\nwhich a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he\r\nwould tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.\r\nMr. Darcy replied, with great intrepidity,--\r\n\r\n“Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all astonishment.\r\nHow long has she been such a favourite? and pray when am I to wish you\r\njoy?”\r\n\r\n“That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady’s\r\nimagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love\r\nto matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as\r\nabsolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and\r\nof course she will be always at Pemberley with you.”\r\n\r\nHe listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to\r\nentertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her\r\nthat all was safe, her wit flowed along.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     “A note for Miss Bennet”\r\n\r\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two\r\nthousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,\r\nin default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s\r\nfortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply\r\nthe deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and\r\nhad left her four thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nShe had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their\r\nfather and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in\r\nLondon in a respectable line of trade.\r\n\r\nThe village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most\r\nconvenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted\r\nthither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and\r\nto a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,\r\nCatherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions:\r\ntheir minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing\r\nbetter offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning\r\nhours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare of\r\nnews the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn\r\nsome from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both\r\nwith news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in\r\nthe neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was\r\nthe head-quarters.\r\n\r\nTheir visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting\r\nintelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the\r\nofficers’ names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret,\r\nand at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips\r\nvisited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity\r\nunknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.\r\nBingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their\r\nmother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of\r\nan ensign.\r\n\r\nAfter listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.\r\nBennet coolly observed,--\r\n\r\n“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two\r\nof the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but\r\nI am now convinced.”\r\n\r\nCatherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect\r\nindifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and\r\nher hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the\r\nnext morning to London.\r\n\r\n“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so\r\nready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly\r\nof anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.”\r\n\r\n“If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”\r\n\r\n“This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I\r\nhad hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must\r\nso far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly\r\nfoolish.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of\r\ntheir father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will\r\nnot think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I\r\nliked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my\r\nheart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,\r\nshould want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought\r\nColonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in\r\nhis regimentals.”\r\n\r\n“Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain\r\nCarter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did when they first\r\ncame; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke’s library.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a\r\nnote for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited\r\nfor an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was\r\neagerly calling out, while her daughter read,--\r\n\r\n“Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,\r\nJane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”\r\n\r\n“It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.\r\n\r\n     /* NIND “My dear friend, */\r\n\r\n     “If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and\r\n     me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our\r\n     lives; for a whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women can never\r\n     end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the receipt of\r\n     this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.\r\n     Yours ever,\r\n\r\n“CAROLINE BINGLEY.”\r\n\r\n“With the officers!” cried Lydia: “I wonder my aunt did not tell us of\r\n_that_.”\r\n\r\n“Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet; “that is very unlucky.”\r\n\r\n“Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.\r\n\r\n“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to\r\nrain; and then you must stay all night.”\r\n\r\n“That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that\r\nthey would not offer to send her home.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to Meryton;\r\nand the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”\r\n\r\n“I had much rather go in the coach.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are\r\nwanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cheerful prognostics]\r\n\r\n“They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”\r\n\r\n“But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s purpose\r\nwill be answered.”\r\n\r\nShe did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses\r\nwere engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her\r\nmother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad\r\nday. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it\r\nrained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was\r\ndelighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;\r\nJane certainly could not come back.\r\n\r\n“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet, more than\r\nonce, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next\r\nmorning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her\r\ncontrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield\r\nbrought the following note for Elizabeth:--\r\n\r\n     /* NIND “My dearest Lizzie, */\r\n\r\n     “I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be\r\n     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will\r\n     not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on\r\n     my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear\r\n     of his having been to me--and, excepting a sore throat and a\r\n     headache, there is not much the matter with me.\r\n\r\n“Yours, etc.”\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note\r\naloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she\r\nshould die--it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of\r\nMr. Bingley, and under your orders.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little\r\ntrifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays\r\nthere, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the\r\ncarriage.”\r\n\r\nElizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though the\r\ncarriage was not to be had: and as she was no horsewoman, walking was\r\nher only alternative. She declared her resolution.\r\n\r\n“How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a\r\nthing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\n“I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.”\r\n\r\n“Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the\r\nhorses?”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing,\r\nwhen one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.”\r\n\r\n“I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every\r\nimpulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,\r\nexertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”\r\n\r\n“We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.\r\nElizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n“If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may\r\nsee something of Captain Carter, before he goes.”\r\n\r\nIn Meryton they parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one\r\nof the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing\r\nfield after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing\r\nover puddles, with impatient activity, and finding herself at last\r\nwithin view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face\r\nglowing with the warmth of exercise.\r\n\r\nShe was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but Jane were\r\nassembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.\r\nThat she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such\r\ndirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and\r\nMiss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt\r\nfor it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their\r\nbrother’s manners there was something better than politeness--there was\r\ngood-humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst\r\nnothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the\r\nbrilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to\r\nthe occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was\r\nthinking only of his breakfast.\r\n\r\nHer inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss\r\nBennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well\r\nenough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her\r\nimmediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving\r\nalarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed\r\nfor such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,\r\nhowever, to much conversation; and when Miss Bingley left them together,\r\ncould attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the\r\nextraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended\r\nher.\r\n\r\nWhen breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth\r\nbegan to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and\r\nsolicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came; and having\r\nexamined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a\r\nviolent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;\r\nadvised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice\r\nwas followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head\r\nached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were\r\nthe other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact\r\nnothing to do elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWhen the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very\r\nunwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only\r\nwanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern\r\nat parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer\r\nof the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the\r\npresent. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was\r\ndespatched to Longbourn, to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring\r\nback a supply of clothes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n“The Apothecary came”\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n“covering a screen”\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAt five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six\r\nElizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then\r\npoured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the\r\nmuch superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley, she could not make a very\r\nfavourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing\r\nthis, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how\r\nshocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked\r\nbeing ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their\r\nindifference towards Jane, when not immediately before them, restored\r\nElizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.\r\n\r\nTheir brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could\r\nregard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his\r\nattentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feeling\r\nherself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the\r\nothers. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was\r\nengrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.\r\nHurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to\r\neat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plain\r\ndish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\r\n\r\nWhen dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley\r\nbegan abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were\r\npronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of pride and impertinence:\r\nshe had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst\r\nthought the same, and added,--\r\n\r\n“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent\r\nwalker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really\r\nlooked almost wild.”\r\n\r\n“She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very\r\nnonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the\r\ncountry, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowzy!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep\r\nin mud, I am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to\r\nhide it not doing its office.”\r\n\r\n“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was\r\nall lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well\r\nwhen she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite\r\nescaped my notice.”\r\n\r\n“_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am\r\ninclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such\r\nan exhibition.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not.”\r\n\r\n“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,\r\nabove her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by\r\nit? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,\r\na most country-town indifference to decorum.”\r\n\r\n“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said\r\nBingley.\r\n\r\n“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,\r\n“that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine\r\neyes.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” he replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.” A\r\nshort pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again,--\r\n\r\n“I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,--she is really a very sweet\r\ngirl,--and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such\r\na father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no\r\nchance of it.”\r\n\r\n“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in\r\nMeryton?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”\r\n\r\n“That is capital,” added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n“If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it\r\nwould not make them one jot less agreeable.”\r\n\r\n“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any\r\nconsideration in the world,” replied Darcy.\r\n\r\nTo this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their\r\nhearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of\r\ntheir dear friend’s vulgar relations.\r\n\r\nWith a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on\r\nleaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.\r\nShe was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till\r\nlate in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and\r\nwhen it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go\r\ndown stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room, she found the whole\r\nparty at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting\r\nthem to be playing high, she declined it, and making her sister the\r\nexcuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could stay\r\nbelow, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\r\n\r\n“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great\r\nreader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”\r\n\r\n“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I\r\nam _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”\r\n\r\n“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and\r\nI hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.”\r\n\r\nElizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table\r\nwhere a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her\r\nothers; all that his library afforded.\r\n\r\n“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own\r\ncredit; but I am an idle fellow; and though I have not many, I have more\r\nthan I ever looked into.”\r\n\r\nElizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those\r\nin the room.\r\n\r\n“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left\r\nso small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at\r\nPemberley, Mr. Darcy!”\r\n\r\n“It ought to be good,” he replied: “it has been the work of many\r\ngenerations.”\r\n\r\n“And then you have added so much to it yourself--you are always buying\r\nbooks.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as\r\nthese.”\r\n\r\n“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of\r\nthat noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be\r\nhalf as delightful as Pemberley.”\r\n\r\n“I wish it may.”\r\n\r\n“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\r\nneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a\r\nfiner county in England than Derbyshire.”\r\n\r\n“With all my heart: I will buy Pemberley itself, if Darcy will sell it.”\r\n\r\n“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”\r\n\r\n“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\r\nPemberley by purchase than by imitation.”\r\n\r\nElizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little\r\nattention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near\r\nthe card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest\r\nsister, to observe the game.\r\n\r\n“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley: “will\r\nshe be as tall as I am?”\r\n\r\n“I think she will.

Such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished\r\nfor her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”\r\n\r\n“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience\r\nto be so very accomplished as they all are.”\r\n\r\n“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and\r\nnet purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and I am\r\nsure I never heard a young"

She promised us south rooms with a view close\r\ntogether, instead of which here are north rooms, looking into a\r\ncourtyard, and a long way apart. Oh, Lucy!”\r\n\r\n“And a Cockney, besides!” said Lucy, who had been further saddened by\r\nthe Signora’s unexpected accent. “It might be London.” She looked at\r\nthe two rows of English people who were sitting at the table; at the\r\nrow of white bottles of water and red bottles of wine that ran between\r\nthe English people; at the portraits of the late Queen and the late\r\nPoet Laureate that hung behind the English people, heavily framed; at\r\nthe notice of the English church (Rev. Cuthbert Eager, M. A. Oxon.),\r\nthat was the only other decoration of the wall. “Charlotte, don’t you\r\nfeel, too, that we might be in London? I can hardly believe that all\r\nkinds of other things are just outside. I suppose it is one’s being so\r\ntired.”\r\n\r\n“This meat has surely been used for soup,” said Miss Bartlett, laying\r\ndown her fork.\r\n\r\n“I want so to see the Arno. The rooms the Signora promised us in her\r\nletter would have looked over the Arno. The Signora had no business to\r\ndo it at all. Oh, it is a shame!”\r\n\r\n“Any nook does for me,” Miss Bartlett continued; “but it does seem hard\r\nthat you shouldn’t have a view.”\r\n\r\nLucy felt that she had been selfish. “Charlotte, you mustn’t spoil me:\r\nof course, you must look over the Arno, too. I meant that. The first\r\nvacant room in the front—” “You must have it,” said Miss Bartlett, part\r\nof whose travelling expenses were paid by Lucy’s mother—a piece of\r\ngenerosity to which she made many a tactful allusion.\r\n\r\n“No, no. You must have it.”\r\n\r\n“I insist on it. Your mother would never forgive me, Lucy.”\r\n\r\n“She would never forgive _me_.”\r\n\r\nThe ladies’ voices grew animated, and—if the sad truth be owned—a\r\nlittle peevish. They were tired, and under the guise of unselfishness\r\nthey wrangled. Some of their neighbours interchanged glances, and one\r\nof them—one of the ill-bred people whom one does meet abroad—leant\r\nforward over the table and actually intruded into their argument. He\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“I have a view, I have a view.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett was startled. Generally at a pension people looked them\r\nover for a day or two before speaking, and often did not find out that\r\nthey would “do” till they had gone. She knew that the intruder was\r\nill-bred, even before she glanced at him. He was an old man, of heavy\r\nbuild, with a fair, shaven face and large eyes. There was something\r\nchildish in those eyes, though it was not the childishness of senility.\r\nWhat exactly it was Miss Bartlett did not stop to consider, for her\r\nglance passed on to his clothes. These did not attract her. He was\r\nprobably trying to become acquainted with them before they got into the\r\nswim. So she assumed a dazed expression when he spoke to her, and then\r\nsaid: “A view? Oh, a view! How delightful a view is!”\r\n\r\n“This is my son,” said the old man; “his name’s George. He has a view\r\ntoo.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Miss Bartlett, repressing Lucy, who was about to speak.\r\n\r\n“What I mean,” he continued, “is that you can have our rooms, and we’ll\r\nhave yours. We’ll change.”\r\n\r\nThe better class of tourist was shocked at this, and sympathized with\r\nthe new-comers. Miss Bartlett, in reply, opened her mouth as little as\r\npossible, and said “Thank you very much indeed; that is out of the\r\nquestion.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” said the old man, with both fists on the table.\r\n\r\n“Because it is quite out of the question, thank you.”\r\n\r\n“You see, we don’t like to take—” began Lucy. Her cousin again\r\nrepressed her.\r\n\r\n“But why?” he persisted. “Women like looking at a view; men don’t.” And\r\nhe thumped with his fists like a naughty child, and turned to his son,\r\nsaying, “George, persuade them!”\r\n\r\n“It’s so obvious they should have the rooms,” said the son. “There’s\r\nnothing else to say.”\r\n\r\nHe did not look at the ladies as he spoke, but his voice was perplexed\r\nand sorrowful. Lucy, too, was perplexed; but she saw that they were in\r\nfor what is known as “quite a scene,” and she had an odd feeling that\r\nwhenever these ill-bred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened\r\ntill it dealt, not with rooms and views, but with—well, with something\r\nquite different, whose existence she had not realized before. Now the\r\nold man attacked Miss Bartlett almost violently: Why should she not\r\nchange? What possible objection had she? They would clear out in half\r\nan hour.\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett, though skilled in the delicacies of conversation, was\r\npowerless in the presence of brutality. It was impossible to snub any\r\none so gross. Her face reddened with displeasure. She looked around as\r\nmuch as to say, “Are you all like this?” And two little old ladies, who\r\nwere sitting further up the table, with shawls hanging over the backs\r\nof the chairs, looked back, clearly indicating “We are not; we are\r\ngenteel.”\r\n\r\n“Eat your dinner, dear,” she said to Lucy, and began to toy again with\r\nthe meat that she had once censured.\r\n\r\nLucy mumbled that those seemed very odd people opposite.\r\n\r\n“Eat your dinner, dear. This pension is a failure. To-morrow we will\r\nmake a change.”\r\n\r\nHardly had she announced this fell decision when she reversed it. The\r\ncurtains at the end of the room parted, and revealed a clergyman, stout\r\nbut attractive, who hurried forward to take his place at the table,\r\ncheerfully apologizing for his lateness. Lucy, who had not yet acquired\r\ndecency, at once rose to her feet, exclaiming: “Oh, oh! Why, it’s Mr.\r\nBeebe! Oh, how perfectly lovely! Oh, Charlotte, we must stop now,\r\nhowever bad the rooms are. Oh!”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett said, with more restraint:\r\n\r\n“How do you do, Mr. Beebe? I expect that you have forgotten us: Miss\r\nBartlett and Miss Honeychurch, who were at Tunbridge Wells when you\r\nhelped the Vicar of St. Peter’s that very cold Easter.”\r\n\r\nThe clergyman, who had the air of one on a holiday, did not remember\r\nthe ladies quite as clearly as they remembered him. But he came forward\r\npleasantly enough and accepted the chair into which he was beckoned by\r\nLucy.\r\n\r\n“I _am_ so glad to see you,” said the girl, who was in a state of\r\nspiritual starvation, and would have been glad to see the waiter if her\r\ncousin had permitted it. “Just fancy how small the world is. Summer\r\nStreet, too, makes it so specially funny.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Honeychurch lives in the parish of Summer Street,” said Miss\r\nBartlett, filling up the gap, “and she happened to tell me in the\r\ncourse of conversation that you have just accepted the living—”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I heard from mother so last week. She didn’t know that I knew you\r\nat Tunbridge Wells; but I wrote back at once, and I said: ‘Mr. Beebe\r\nis—’”\r\n\r\n“Quite right,” said the clergyman. “I move into the Rectory at Summer\r\nStreet next June. I am lucky to be appointed to such a charming\r\nneighbourhood.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, how glad I am! The name of our house is Windy Corner.” Mr. Beebe\r\nbowed.\r\n\r\n“There is mother and me generally, and my brother, though it’s not\r\noften we get him to ch—— The church is rather far off, I mean.”\r\n\r\n“Lucy, dearest, let Mr. Beebe eat his dinner.”\r\n\r\n“I am eating it, thank you, and enjoying it.”\r\n\r\nHe preferred to talk to Lucy, whose playing he remembered, rather than\r\nto Miss Bartlett, who probably remembered his sermons. He asked the\r\ngirl whether she knew Florence well, and was informed at some length\r\nthat she had never been there before. It is delightful to advise a\r\nnewcomer, and he was first in the field. “Don’t neglect the country\r\nround,” his advice concluded. “The first fine afternoon drive up to\r\nFiesole, and round by Settignano, or something of that sort.”\r\n\r\n“No!” cried a voice from the top of the table. “Mr. Beebe, you are\r\nwrong. The first fine afternoon your ladies must go to Prato.”\r\n\r\n“That lady looks so clever,” whispered Miss Bartlett to her cousin. “We\r\nare in luck.”\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, a perfect torrent of information burst on them. People\r\ntold them what to see, when to see it, how to stop the electric trams,\r\nhow to get rid of the beggars, how much to give for a vellum blotter,\r\nhow much the place would grow upon them. The Pension Bertolini had\r\ndecided, almost enthusiastically, that they would do. Whichever way\r\nthey looked, kind ladies smiled and shouted at them. And above all rose\r\nthe voice of the clever lady, crying: “Prato! They must go to Prato.\r\nThat place is too sweetly squalid for words. I love it; I revel in\r\nshaking off the trammels of respectability, as you know.”\r\n\r\nThe young man named George glanced at the clever lady, and then\r\nreturned moodily to his plate. Obviously he and his father did not do.\r\nLucy, in the midst of her success, found time to wish they did. It gave\r\nher no extra pleasure that any one should be left in the cold; and when\r\nshe rose to go, she turned back and gave the two outsiders a nervous\r\nlittle bow.\r\n\r\nThe father did not see it; the son acknowledged it, not by another bow,\r\nbut by raising his eyebrows and smiling; he seemed to be smiling across\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nShe hastened after her cousin, who had already disappeared through the\r\ncurtains—curtains which smote one in the face, and seemed heavy with\r\nmore than cloth. Beyond them stood the unreliable Signora, bowing\r\ngood-evening to her guests, and supported by ’Enery, her little boy,\r\nand Victorier, her daughter. It made a curious little scene, this\r\nattempt of the Cockney to convey the grace and geniality of the South.\r\nAnd even more curious was the drawing-room, which attempted to rival\r\nthe solid comfort of a Bloomsbury boarding-house. Was this really\r\nItaly?\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett was already seated on a tightly stuffed arm-chair, which\r\nhad the colour and the contours of a tomato. She was talking to Mr.\r\nBeebe, and as she spoke, her long narrow head drove backwards and\r\nforwards, slowly, regularly, as though she were demolishing some\r\ninvisible obstacle. “We are most grateful to you,” she was saying. “The\r\nfirst evening means so much. When you arrived we were in for a\r\npeculiarly _mauvais quart d’heure_.”\r\n\r\nHe expressed his regret.\r\n\r\n“Do you, by any chance, know the name of an old man who sat opposite us\r\nat dinner?”\r\n\r\n“Emerson.”\r\n\r\n“Is he a friend of yours?”\r\n\r\n“We are friendly—as one is in pensions.”\r\n\r\n“Then I will say no more.”\r\n\r\nHe pressed her very slightly, and she said more.\r\n\r\n“I am, as it were,” she concluded, “the chaperon of my young cousin,\r\nLucy, and it would be a serious thing if I put her under an obligation\r\nto people of whom we know nothing. His manner was somewhat unfortunate.\r\nI hope I acted for the best.”\r\n\r\n“You acted very naturally,” said he. He seemed thoughtful, and after a\r\nfew moments added: “All the same, I don’t think much harm would have\r\ncome of accepting.”\r\n\r\n“No _harm_, of course. But we could not be under an obligation.”\r\n\r\n“He is rather a peculiar man.” Again he hesitated, and then said\r\ngently: “I think he would not take advantage of your acceptance, nor\r\nexpect you to show gratitude. He has the merit—if it is one—of saying\r\nexactly what he means. He has rooms he does not value, and he thinks\r\nyou would value them. He no more thought of putting you under an\r\nobligation than he thought of being polite. It is so difficult—at\r\nleast, I find it difficult—to understand people who speak the truth.”\r\n\r\nLucy was pleased, and said: “I was hoping that he was nice; I do so\r\nalways hope that people will be nice.”\r\n\r\n“I think he is; nice and tiresome. I differ from him on almost every\r\npoint of any importance, and so, I expect—I may say I hope—you will\r\ndiffer. But his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores. When\r\nhe first came here he not unnaturally put people’s backs up. He has no\r\ntact and no manners—I don’t mean by that that he has bad manners—and he\r\nwill not keep his opinions to himself. We nearly complained about him\r\nto our depressing Signora, but I am glad to say we thought better of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Am I to conclude,” said Miss Bartlett, “that he is a Socialist?”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe accepted the convenient word, not without a slight twitching\r\nof the lips.\r\n\r\n“And presumably he has brought up his son to be a Socialist, too?”\r\n\r\n“I hardly know George, for he hasn’t learnt to talk yet. He seems a\r\nnice creature, and I think he has brains. Of course, he has all his\r\nfather’s mannerisms, and it is quite possible that he, too, may be a\r\nSocialist.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you relieve me,” said Miss Bartlett. “So you think I ought to have\r\naccepted their offer? You feel I have been narrow-minded and\r\nsuspicious?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” he answered; “I never suggested that.”\r\n\r\n“But ought I not to apologize, at all events, for my apparent\r\nrudeness?”\r\n\r\nHe replied, with some irritation, that it would be quite unnecessary,\r\nand got up from his seat to go to the smoking-room.\r\n\r\n“Was I a bore?” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had disappeared. “Why\r\ndidn’t you talk, Lucy? He prefers young people, I’m sure. I do hope I\r\nhaven’t monopolized him. I hoped you would have him all the evening, as\r\nwell as all dinner-time.”\r\n\r\n“He is nice,” exclaimed Lucy. “Just what I remember. He seems to see\r\ngood in everyone. No one would take him for a clergyman.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Lucia—”\r\n\r\n“Well, you know what I mean. And you know how clergymen generally\r\nlaugh; Mr. Beebe laughs just like an ordinary man.”\r\n\r\n“Funny girl! How you do remind me of your mother. I wonder if she will\r\napprove of Mr. Beebe.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure she will; and so will Freddy.”\r\n\r\n“I think everyone at Windy Corner will approve; it is the fashionable\r\nworld. I am used to Tunbridge Wells, where we are all hopelessly behind\r\nthe times.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Lucy despondently.\r\n\r\nThere was a haze of disapproval in the air, but whether the disapproval\r\nwas of herself, or of Mr. Beebe, or of the fashionable world at Windy\r\nCorner, or of the narrow world at Tunbridge Wells, she could not\r\ndetermine. She tried to locate it, but as usual she blundered. Miss\r\nBartlett sedulously denied disapproving of any one, and added “I am\r\nafraid you are finding me a very depressing companion.”\r\n\r\nAnd the girl again thought: “I must have been selfish or unkind; I must\r\nbe more careful. It is so dreadful for Charlotte, being poor.”\r\n\r\nFortunately one of the little old ladies, who for some time had been\r\nsmiling very benignly, now approached and asked if she might be allowed\r\nto sit where Mr. Beebe had sat. Permission granted, she began to\r\nchatter gently about Italy, the plunge it had been to come there, the\r\ngratifying success of the plunge, the improvement in her sister’s\r\nhealth, the necessity of closing the bed-room windows at night, and of\r\nthoroughly emptying the water-bottles in the morning. She handled her\r\nsubjects agreeably, and they were, perhaps, more worthy of attention\r\nthan the high discourse upon Guelfs and Ghibellines which was\r\nproceeding tempestuously at the other end of the room. It was a real\r\ncatastrophe, not a mere episode, that evening of hers at Venice, when\r\nshe had found in her bedroom something that is one worse than a flea,\r\nthough one better than something else.\r\n\r\n“But here you are as safe as in England. Signora Bertolini is so\r\nEnglish.”\r\n\r\n“Yet our rooms smell,” said poor Lucy. “We dread going to bed.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, then you look into the court.” She sighed. “If only Mr. Emerson\r\nwas more tactful! We were so sorry for you at dinner.”\r\n\r\n“I think he was meaning to be kind.”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly he was,” said Miss Bartlett.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature. Of\r\ncourse, I was holding back on my cousin’s account.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said the little old lady; and they murmured that one could\r\nnot be too careful with a young girl.\r\n\r\nLucy tried to look demure, but could not help feeling a great fool. No\r\none was careful with her at home; or, at all events, she had not\r\nnoticed it.\r\n\r\n“About old Mr. Emerson—I hardly know. No, he is not tactful; yet, have\r\nyou ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most\r\nindelicate, and yet at the same time—beautiful?”\r\n\r\n“Beautiful?” said Miss Bartlett, puzzled at the word. “Are not beauty\r\nand delicacy the same?”\r\n\r\n“So one would have thought,” said the other helplessly. “But things are\r\nso difficult, I sometimes think.”\r\n\r\nShe proceeded no further into things, for Mr. Beebe reappeared, looking\r\nextremely pleasant.\r\n\r\n“Miss Bartlett,” he cried, “it’s all right about the rooms. I’m so\r\nglad. Mr. Emerson was talking about it in the smoking-room, and knowing\r\nwhat I did, I encouraged him to make the offer again. He has let me\r\ncome and ask you. He would be so pleased.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Charlotte,” cried Lucy to her cousin, “we must have the rooms now.\r\nThe old man is just as nice and kind as he can be.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett was silent.\r\n\r\n“I fear,” said Mr. Beebe, after a pause, “that I have been officious. I\r\nmust apologize for my interference.”\r\n\r\nGravely displeased, he turned to go. Not till then did Miss Bartlett\r\nreply: “My own wishes, dearest Lucy, are unimportant in comparison with\r\nyours. It would be hard indeed if I stopped you doing as you liked at\r\nFlorence, when I am only here through your kindness. If you wish me to\r\nturn these gentlemen out of their rooms, I will do it. Would you then,\r\nMr. Beebe, kindly tell Mr. Emerson that I accept his kind offer, and\r\nthen conduct him to me, in order that I may thank him personally?”\r\n\r\nShe raised her voice as she spoke; it was heard all over the\r\ndrawing-room, and silenced the Guelfs and the Ghibellines. The\r\nclergyman, inwardly cursing the female sex, bowed, and departed with\r\nher message.\r\n\r\n“Remember, Lucy, I alone am implicated in this. I do not wish the\r\nacceptance to come from you. Grant me that, at all events.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe was back, saying rather nervously:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Emerson is engaged, but here is his son instead.”\r\n\r\nThe young man gazed down on the three ladies, who felt seated on the\r\nfloor, so low were their chairs.\r\n\r\n“My father,” he said, “is in his bath, so you cannot thank him\r\npersonally. But any message given by you to me will be given by me to\r\nhim as soon as he comes out.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett was unequal to the bath. All her barbed civilities came\r\nforth wrong end first. Young Mr. Emerson scored a notable triumph to\r\nthe delight of Mr. Beebe and to the secret delight of Lucy.\r\n\r\n“Poor young man!” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had gone.\r\n\r\n“How angry he is with his father about the rooms! It is all he can do\r\nto keep polite.”\r\n\r\n“In half an hour or so your rooms will be ready,” said Mr. Beebe. Then\r\nlooking rather thoughtfully at the two cousins, he retired to his own\r\nrooms, to write up his philosophic diary.\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear!” breathed the little old lady, and shuddered as if all the\r\nwinds of heaven had entered the apartment. “Gentlemen sometimes do not\r\nrealize—” Her voice faded away, but Miss Bartlett seemed to understand\r\nand a conversation developed, in which gentlemen who did not thoroughly\r\nrealize played a principal part. Lucy, not realizing either, was\r\nreduced to literature. Taking up Baedeker’s Handbook to Northern Italy,\r\nshe committed to memory the most important dates of Florentine History.\r\nFor she was determined to enjoy herself on the morrow. Thus the\r\nhalf-hour crept profitably away, and at last Miss Bartlett rose with a\r\nsigh, and said:\r\n\r\n“I think one might venture now. No, Lucy, do not stir. I will\r\nsuperintend the move.”\r\n\r\n“How you do do everything,” said Lucy.\r\n\r\n“Naturally, dear. It is my affair.”\r\n\r\n“But I would like to help you.”\r\n\r\n“No, dear.”\r\n\r\nCharlotte’s energy! And her unselfishness! She had been thus all her\r\nlife, but really, on this Italian tour, she was surpassing herself. So\r\nLucy felt, or strove to feel. And yet—there was a rebellious spirit in\r\nher which wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less\r\ndelicate and more beautiful. At all events, she entered her own room\r\nwithout any feeling of joy.\r\n\r\n“I want to explain,” said Miss Bartlett, “why it is that I have taken\r\nthe largest room. Naturally, of course, I should have given it to you;\r\nbut I happen to know that it belongs to the young man, and I was sure\r\nyour mother would not like it.”\r\n\r\nLucy was bewildered.\r\n\r\n“If you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under\r\nan obligation to his father than to him. I am a woman of the world, in\r\nmy small way, and I know where things lead to. However, Mr. Beebe is a\r\nguarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this.”\r\n\r\n“Mother wouldn’t mind I’m sure,” said Lucy, but again had the sense of\r\nlarger and unsuspected issues.\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett only sighed, and enveloped her in a protecting embrace as\r\nshe wished her good-night. It gave Lucy the sensation of a fog, and\r\nwhen she reached her own room she opened the window and breathed the\r\nclean night air, thinking of the kind old man who had enabled her to\r\nsee the lights dancing in the Arno and the cypresses of San Miniato,\r\nand the foot-hills of the Apennines, black against the rising moon.\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett, in her room, fastened the window-shutters and locked the\r\ndoor, and then made a tour of the apartment to see where the cupboards\r\nled, and whether there were any oubliettes or secret entrances. It was\r\nthen that she saw, pinned up over the washstand, a sheet of paper on\r\nwhich was scrawled an enormous note of interrogation. Nothing more.\r\n\r\n“What does it mean?” she thought, and she examined it carefully by the\r\nlight of a candle. Meaningless at first, it gradually became menacing,\r\nobnoxious, portentous with evil. She was seized with an impulse to\r\ndestroy it, but fortunately remembered that she had no right to do so,\r\nsince it must be the property of young Mr. Emerson. So she unpinned it\r\ncarefully, and put it between two pieces of blotting-paper to keep it\r\nclean for him. Then she completed her inspection of the room, sighed\r\nheavily according to her habit, and went to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\nIn Santa Croce with No Baedeker\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was pleasant to wake up in Florence, to open the eyes upon a bright\r\nbare room, with a floor of red tiles which look clean though they are\r\nnot; with a painted ceiling whereon pink griffins and blue amorini\r\nsport in a forest of yellow violins and bassoons. It was pleasant, too,\r\nto fling wide the windows, pinching the fingers in unfamiliar\r\nfastenings, to lean out into sunshine with beautiful hills and trees\r\nand marble churches opposite, and close below, the Arno, gurgling\r\nagainst the embankment of the road.\r\n\r\nOver the river men were at work with spades and sieves on the sandy\r\nforeshore, and on the river was a boat, also diligently employed for\r\nsome mysterious end. An electric tram came rushing underneath the\r\nwindow. No one was inside it, except one tourist; but its platforms\r\nwere overflowing with Italians, who preferred to stand. Children tried\r\nto hang on behind, and the conductor, with no malice, spat in their\r\nfaces to make them let go. Then soldiers appeared—good-looking,\r\nundersized men—wearing each a knapsack covered with mangy fur, and a\r\ngreat-coat which had been cut for some larger soldier. Beside them\r\nwalked officers, looking foolish and fierce, and before them went\r\nlittle boys, turning somersaults in time with the band. The tramcar\r\nbecame entangled in their ranks, and moved on painfully, like a\r\ncaterpillar in a swarm of ants. One of the little boys fell down, and\r\nsome white bullocks came out of an archway. Indeed, if it had not been\r\nfor the good advice of an old man who was selling button-hooks, the\r\nroad might never have got clear.\r\n\r\nOver such trivialities as these many a valuable hour may slip away, and\r\nthe traveller who has gone to Italy to study the tactile values of\r\nGiotto, or the corruption of the Papacy, may return remembering nothing\r\nbut the blue sky and the men and women who live under it. So it was as\r\nwell that Miss Bartlett should tap and come in, and having commented on\r\nLucy’s leaving the door unlocked, and on her leaning out of the window\r\nbefore she was fully dressed, should urge her to hasten herself, or the\r\nbest of the day would be gone. By the time Lucy was ready her cousin\r\nhad done her breakfast, and was listening to the clever lady among the\r\ncrumbs.\r\n\r\nA conversation then ensued, on not unfamiliar lines. Miss Bartlett was,\r\nafter all, a wee bit tired, and thought they had better spend the\r\nmorning settling in; unless Lucy would at all like to go out? Lucy\r\nwould rather like to go out, as it was her first day in Florence, but,\r\nof course, she could go alone. Miss Bartlett could not allow this. Of\r\ncourse she would accompany Lucy everywhere. Oh, certainly not; Lucy\r\nwould stop with her cousin. Oh, no! that would never do. Oh, yes!\r\n\r\nAt this point the clever lady broke in.\r\n\r\n“If it is Mrs. Grundy who is troubling you, I do assure you that you\r\ncan neglect the good person. Being English, Miss Honeychurch will be\r\nperfectly safe. Italians understand. A dear friend of mine, Contessa\r\nBaroncelli, has two daughters, and when she cannot send a maid to\r\nschool with them, she lets them go in sailor-hats instead. Every one\r\ntakes them for English, you see, especially if their hair is strained\r\ntightly behind.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett was unconvinced by the safety of Contessa Baroncelli’s\r\ndaughters. She was determined to take Lucy herself, her head not being\r\nso very bad. The clever lady then said that she was going to spend a\r\nlong morning in Santa Croce, and if Lucy would come too, she would be\r\ndelighted.\r\n\r\n“I will take you by a dear dirty back way, Miss Honeychurch, and if you\r\nbring me luck, we shall have an adventure.”\r\n\r\nLucy said that this was most kind, and at once opened the Baedeker, to\r\nsee where Santa Croce was.\r\n\r\n“Tut, tut! Miss Lucy! I hope we shall soon emancipate you from\r\nBaedeker. He does but touch the surface of things. As to the true\r\nItaly—he does not even dream of it. The true Italy is only to be found\r\nby patient observation.”\r\n\r\nThis sounded very interesting, and Lucy hurried over her breakfast, and\r\nstarted with her new friend in high spirits. Italy was coming at last.\r\nThe Cockney Signora and her works had vanished like a bad dream.\r\n\r\nMiss Lavish—for that was the clever lady’s name—turned to the right\r\nalong the sunny Lung’ Arno. How delightfully warm! But a wind down the\r\nside streets cut like a knife, didn’t it? Ponte alle\r\nGrazie—particularly interesting, mentioned by Dante. San\r\nMiniato—beautiful as well as interesting; the crucifix that kissed a\r\nmurderer—Miss Honeychurch would remember the story. The men on the\r\nriver were fishing. (Untrue; but then, so is most information.) Then\r\nMiss Lavish darted under the archway of the white bullocks, and she\r\nstopped, and she cried:\r\n\r\n“A smell! a true Florentine smell! Every city, let me teach you, has\r\nits own smell.”\r\n\r\n“Is it a very nice smell?” said Lucy, who had inherited from her mother\r\na distaste to dirt.\r\n\r\n“One doesn’t come to Italy for niceness,” was the retort; “one comes\r\nfor life. Buon giorno! Buon giorno!” bowing right and left. “Look at\r\nthat adorable wine-cart! How the driver stares at us, dear, simple\r\nsoul!”\r\n\r\nSo Miss Lavish proceeded through the streets of the city of Florence,\r\nshort, fidgety, and playful as a kitten, though without a kitten’s\r\ngrace. It was a treat for the girl to be with any one so clever and so\r\ncheerful; and a blue military cloak, such as an Italian officer wears,\r\nonly increased the sense of festivity.\r\n\r\n“Buon giorno! Take the word of an old woman, Miss Lucy: you will never\r\nrepent of a little civility to your inferiors. _That_ is the true\r\ndemocracy. Though I am a real Radical as well. There, now you’re\r\nshocked.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, I’m not!” exclaimed Lucy. “We are Radicals, too, out and out.\r\nMy father always voted for Mr. Gladstone, until he was so dreadful\r\nabout Ireland.”\r\n\r\n“I see, I see. And now you have gone over to the enemy.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, please—! If my father was alive, I am sure he would vote Radical\r\nagain now that Ireland is all right. And as it is, the glass over our\r\nfront door was broken last election, and Freddy is sure it was the\r\nTories; but mother says nonsense, a tramp.”\r\n\r\n“Shameful! A manufacturing district, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“No—in the Surrey hills. About five miles from Dorking, looking over\r\nthe Weald.”\r\n\r\nMiss Lavish seemed interested, and slackened her trot.\r\n\r\n“What a delightful part; I know it so well. It is full of the very\r\nnicest people. Do you know Sir Harry Otway—a Radical if ever there\r\nwas?”\r\n\r\n“Very well indeed.”\r\n\r\n“And old Mrs. Butterworth the philanthropist?”\r\n\r\n“Why, she rents a field of us! How funny!”\r\n\r\nMiss Lavish looked at the narrow ribbon of sky, and murmured: “Oh, you\r\nhave property in Surrey?”\r\n\r\n“Hardly any,” said Lucy, fearful of being thought a snob. “Only thirty\r\nacres—just the garden, all downhill, and some fields.”\r\n\r\nMiss Lavish was not disgusted, and said it was just the size of her\r\naunt’s Suffolk estate. Italy receded. They tried to remember the last\r\nname of Lady Louisa someone, who had taken a house near Summer Street\r\nthe other year, but she had not liked it, which was odd of her. And\r\njust as Miss Lavish had got the name, she broke off and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Bless us! Bless us and save us! We’ve lost the way.”\r\n\r\nCertainly they had seemed a long time in reaching Santa Croce, the\r\ntower of which had been plainly visible from the landing window. But\r\nMiss Lavish had said so much about knowing her Florence by heart, that\r\nLucy had followed her with no misgivings.\r\n\r\n“Lost! lost! My dear Miss Lucy, during our political diatribes we have\r\ntaken a wrong turning. How those horrid Conservatives would jeer at us!\r\nWhat are we to do? Two lone females in an unknown town. Now, this is\r\nwhat _I_ call an adventure.”\r\n\r\nLucy, who wanted to see Santa Croce, suggested, as a possible solution,\r\nthat they should ask the way there.\r\n\r\n“Oh, but that is the word of a craven! And no, you are not, not, _not_\r\nto look at your Baedeker. Give it to me; I shan’t let you carry it. We\r\nwill simply drift.”\r\n\r\nAccordingly they drifted through a series of those grey-brown streets,\r\nneither commodious nor picturesque, in which the eastern quarter of the\r\ncity abounds. Lucy soon lost interest in the discontent of Lady Louisa,\r\nand became discontented herself. For one ravishing moment Italy\r\nappeared. She stood in the Square of the Annunziata and saw in the\r\nliving terra-cotta those divine babies whom no cheap reproduction can\r\never stale. There they stood, with their shining limbs bursting from\r\nthe garments of charity, and their strong white arms extended against\r\ncirclets of heaven. Lucy thought she had never seen anything more\r\nbeautiful; but Miss Lavish, with a shriek of dismay, dragged her\r\nforward, declaring that they were out of their path now by at least a\r\nmile.\r\n\r\nThe hour was approaching at which the continental breakfast begins, or\r\nrather ceases, to tell, and the ladies bought some hot chestnut paste\r\nout of a little shop, because it looked so typical. It tasted partly of\r\nthe paper in which it was wrapped, partly of hair oil, partly of the\r\ngreat unknown. But it gave them strength to drift into another Piazza,\r\nlarge and dusty, on the farther side of which rose a black-and-white\r\nfaçade of surpassing ugliness. Miss Lavish spoke to it dramatically. It\r\nwas Santa Croce. The adventure was over.\r\n\r\n“Stop a minute; let those two people go on, or I shall have to speak to\r\nthem. I do detest conventional intercourse. Nasty! they are going into\r\nthe church, too. Oh, the Britisher abroad!”\r\n\r\n“We sat opposite them at dinner last night. They have given us their\r\nrooms. They were so very kind.”\r\n\r\n“Look at their figures!” laughed Miss Lavish. “They walk through my\r\nItaly like a pair of cows. It’s very naughty of me, but I would like to\r\nset an examination paper at Dover, and turn back every tourist who\r\ncouldn’t pass it.”\r\n\r\n“What would you ask us?”\r\n\r\nMiss Lavish laid her hand pleasantly on Lucy’s arm, as if to suggest\r\nthat she, at all events, would get full marks. In this exalted mood\r\nthey reached the steps of the great church, and were about to enter it\r\nwhen Miss Lavish stopped, squeaked, flung up her arms, and cried:\r\n\r\n“There goes my local-colour box! I must have a word with him!”\r\n\r\nAnd in a moment she was away over the Piazza, her military cloak\r\nflapping in the wind; nor did she slacken speed till she caught up an\r\nold man with white whiskers, and nipped him playfully upon the arm.\r\n\r\nLucy waited for nearly ten minutes. Then she began to get tired. The\r\nbeggars worried her, the dust blew in her eyes, and she remembered that\r\na young girl ought not to loiter in public places. She descended slowly\r\ninto the Piazza with the intention of rejoining Miss Lavish, who was\r\nreally almost too original. But at that moment Miss Lavish and her\r\nlocal-colour box moved also, and disappeared down a side street, both\r\ngesticulating largely. Tears of indignation came to Lucy’s eyes partly\r\nbecause Miss Lavish had jilted her, partly because she had taken her\r\nBaedeker. How could she find her way home? How could she find her way\r\nabout in Santa Croce? Her first morning was ruined, and she might never\r\nbe in Florence again. A few minutes ago she had been all high spirits,\r\ntalking as a woman of culture, and half persuading herself that she was\r\nfull of originality. Now she entered the church depressed and\r\nhumiliated, not even able to remember whether it was built by the\r\nFranciscans or the Dominicans. Of course, it must be a wonderful\r\nbuilding. But how like a barn! And how very cold! Of course, it\r\ncontained frescoes by Giotto, in the presence of whose tactile values\r\nshe was capable of feeling what was proper. But who was to tell her\r\nwhich they were? She walked about disdainfully, unwilling to be\r\nenthusiastic over monuments of uncertain authorship or date. There was\r\nno one even to tell her which, of all the sepulchral slabs that paved\r\nthe nave and transepts, was the one that was really beautiful, the one\r\nthat had been most praised by Mr. Ruskin.\r\n\r\nThen the pernicious charm of Italy worked on her, and, instead of\r\nacquiring information, she began to be happy. She puzzled out the\r\nItalian notices—the notices that forbade people to introduce dogs into\r\nthe church—the notice that prayed people, in the interest of health and\r\nout of respect to the sacred edifice in which they found themselves,\r\nnot to spit. She watched the tourists; their noses were as red as their\r\nBaedekers, so cold was Santa Croce. She beheld the horrible fate that\r\novertook three Papists—two he-babies and a she-baby—who began their\r\ncareer by sousing each other with the Holy Water, and then proceeded to\r\nthe Machiavelli memorial, dripping but hallowed. Advancing towards it\r\nvery slowly and from immense distances, they touched the stone with\r\ntheir fingers, with their handkerchiefs, with their heads, and then\r\nretreated. What could this mean? They did it again and again. Then Lucy\r\nrealized that they had mistaken Machiavelli for some saint, hoping to\r\nacquire virtue. Punishment followed quickly. The smallest he-baby\r\nstumbled over one of the sepulchral slabs so much admired by Mr.\r\nRuskin, and entangled his feet in the features of a recumbent bishop.\r\nProtestant as she was, Lucy darted forward. She was too late. He fell\r\nheavily upon the prelate’s upturned toes.\r\n\r\n“Hateful bishop!” exclaimed the voice of old Mr. Emerson, who had\r\ndarted forward also. “Hard in life, hard in death. Go out into the\r\nsunshine, little boy, and kiss your hand to the sun, for that is where\r\nyou ought to be. Intolerable bishop!”\r\n\r\nThe child screamed frantically at these words, and at these dreadful\r\npeople who picked him up, dusted him, rubbed his bruises, and told him\r\nnot to be superstitious.\r\n\r\n“Look at him!” said Mr. Emerson to Lucy. “Here’s a mess: a baby hurt,\r\ncold, and frightened! But what else can you expect from a church?”\r\n\r\nThe child’s legs had become as melting wax. Each time that old Mr.\r\nEmerson and Lucy set it erect it collapsed with a roar. Fortunately an\r\nItalian lady, who ought to have been saying her prayers, came to the\r\nrescue. By some mysterious virtue, which mothers alone possess, she\r\nstiffened the little boy’s back-bone and imparted strength to his\r\nknees. He stood. Still gibbering with agitation, he walked away.\r\n\r\n“You are a clever woman,” said Mr. Emerson. “You have done more than\r\nall the relics in the world. I am not of your creed, but I do believe\r\nin those who make their fellow-creatures happy. There is no scheme of\r\nthe universe—”\r\n\r\nHe paused for a phrase.\r\n\r\n“Niente,” said the Italian lady, and returned to her prayers.\r\n\r\n“I’m not sure she understands English,” suggested Lucy.\r\n\r\nIn her chastened mood she no longer despised the Emersons. She was\r\ndetermined to be gracious to them, beautiful rather than delicate, and,\r\nif possible, to erase Miss Bartlett’s civility by some gracious\r\nreference to the pleasant rooms.\r\n\r\n“That woman understands everything,” was Mr. Emerson’s reply. “But what\r\nare you doing here? Are you doing the church? Are you through with the\r\nchurch?”\r\n\r\n“No,” cried Lucy, remembering her grievance. “I came here with Miss\r\nLavish, who was to explain everything; and just by the door—it is too\r\nbad!—she simply ran away, and after waiting quite a time, I had to come\r\nin by myself.”\r\n\r\n“Why shouldn’t you?” said Mr. Emerson.\r\n\r\n“Yes, why shouldn’t you come by yourself?” said the son, addressing the\r\nyoung lady for the first time.\r\n\r\n“But Miss Lavish has even taken away Baedeker.”\r\n\r\n“Baedeker?” said Mr. Emerson. “I’m glad it’s _that_ you minded. It’s\r\nworth minding, the loss of a Baedeker. _That’s_ worth minding.”\r\n\r\nLucy was puzzled. She was again conscious of some new idea, and was not\r\nsure whither it would lead her.\r\n\r\n“If you’ve no Baedeker,” said the son, “you’d better join us.” Was this\r\nwhere the idea would lead? She took refuge in her dignity.\r\n\r\n“Thank you very much, but I could not think of that. I hope you do not\r\nsuppose that I came to join on to you. I really came to help with the\r\nchild, and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night.\r\nI hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience.”\r\n\r\n“My dear,” said the old man gently, “I think that you are repeating\r\nwhat you have heard older people say. You are pretending to be touchy;\r\nbut you are not really. Stop being so tiresome, and tell me instead\r\nwhat part of the church you want to see. To take you to it will be a\r\nreal pleasure.”\r\n\r\nNow, this was abominably impertinent, and she ought to have been\r\nfurious. But it is sometimes as difficult to lose one’s temper as it is\r\ndifficult at other times to keep it. Lucy could not get cross. Mr.\r\nEmerson was an old man, and surely a girl might humour him. On the\r\nother hand, his son was a young man, and she felt that a girl ought to\r\nbe offended with him, or at all events be offended before him. It was\r\nat him that she gazed before replying.\r\n\r\n“I am not touchy, I hope. It is the Giottos that I want to see, if you\r\nwill kindly tell me which they are.”\r\n\r\nThe son nodded. With a look of sombre satisfaction, he led the way to\r\nthe Peruzzi Chapel. There was a hint of the teacher about him. She felt\r\nlike a child in school who had answered a question rightly.\r\n\r\nThe chapel was already filled with an earnest congregation, and out of\r\nthem rose the voice of a lecturer, directing them how to worship\r\nGiotto, not by tactful valuations, but by the standards of the spirit.\r\n\r\n“Remember,” he was saying, “the facts about this church of Santa Croce;\r\nhow it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism, before\r\nany taint of the Renaissance had appeared. Observe how Giotto in these\r\nfrescoes—now, unhappily, ruined by restoration—is untroubled by the\r\nsnares of anatomy and perspective. Could anything be more majestic,\r\nmore pathetic, beautiful, true? How little, we feel, avails knowledge\r\nand technical cleverness against a man who truly feels!”\r\n\r\n“No!” exclaimed Mr. Emerson, in much too loud a voice for church.\r\n“Remember nothing of the sort! Built by faith indeed! That simply means\r\nthe workmen weren’t paid properly. And as for the frescoes, I see no\r\ntruth in them. Look at that fat man in blue! He must weigh as much as I\r\ndo, and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon.”\r\n\r\nHe was referring to the fresco of the “Ascension of St. John.” Inside,\r\nthe lecturer’s voice faltered, as well it might. The audience shifted\r\nuneasily, and so did Lucy. She was sure that she ought not to be with\r\nthese men; but they had cast a spell over her. They were so serious and\r\nso strange that she could not remember how to behave.\r\n\r\n“Now, did this happen, or didn’t it? Yes or no?”\r\n\r\nGeorge replied:\r\n\r\n“It happened like this, if it happened at all. I would rather go up to\r\nheaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs; and if I got there I should\r\nlike my friends to lean out of it, just as they do here.”\r\n\r\n“You will never go up,” said his father. “You and I, dear boy, will lie\r\nat peace in the earth that bore us, and our names will disappear as\r\nsurely as our work survives.”\r\n\r\n“Some of the people can only see the empty grave, not the saint,\r\nwhoever he is, going up. It did happen like that, if it happened at\r\nall.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” said a frigid voice. “The chapel is somewhat small for two\r\nparties. We will incommode you no longer.”\r\n\r\nThe lecturer was a clergyman, and his audience must be also his flock,\r\nfor they held prayer-books as well as guide-books in their hands. They\r\nfiled out of the chapel in silence. Amongst them were the two little\r\nold ladies of the Pension Bertolini—Miss Teresa and Miss Catherine\r\nAlan.\r\n\r\n“Stop!” cried Mr. Emerson. “There’s plenty of room for us all. Stop!”\r\n\r\nThe procession disappeared without a word.\r\n\r\nSoon the lecturer could be heard in the next chapel, describing the\r\nlife of St. Francis.\r\n\r\n“George, I do believe that clergyman is the Brixton curate.”\r\n\r\nGeorge went into the next chapel and returned, saying “Perhaps he is. I\r\ndon’t remember.”\r\n\r\n“Then I had better speak to him and remind him who I am. It’s that Mr.\r\nEager. Why did he go? Did we talk too loud? How vexatious. I shall go\r\nand say we are sorry. Hadn’t I better? Then perhaps he will come back.”\r\n\r\n“He will not come back,” said George.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Emerson, contrite and unhappy, hurried away to apologize to the\r\nRev. Cuthbert Eager. Lucy, apparently absorbed in a lunette, could hear\r\nthe lecture again interrupted, the anxious, aggressive voice of the old\r\nman, the curt, injured replies of his opponent. The son, who took every\r\nlittle contretemps as if it were a tragedy, was listening also.\r\n\r\n“My father has that effect on nearly everyone,” he informed her. “He\r\nwill try to be kind.”\r\n\r\n“I hope we all try,” said she, smiling nervously.\r\n\r\n“Because we think it improves our characters. But he is kind to people\r\nbecause he loves them; and they find him out, and are offended, or\r\nfrightened.”\r\n\r\n“How silly of them!” said Lucy, though in her heart she sympathized; “I\r\nthink that a kind action done tactfully—”\r\n\r\n“Tact!”\r\n\r\nHe threw up his head in disdain. Apparently she had given the wrong\r\nanswer. She watched the singular creature pace up and down the chapel.\r\nFor a young man his face was rugged, and—until the shadows fell upon\r\nit—hard. Enshadowed, it sprang into tenderness. She saw him once again\r\nat Rome, on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, carrying a burden of\r\nacorns. Healthy and muscular, he yet gave her the feeling of greyness,\r\nof tragedy that might only find solution in the night. The feeling soon\r\npassed; it was unlike her to have entertained anything so subtle. Born\r\nof silence and of unknown emotion, it passed when Mr. Emerson returned,\r\nand she could re-enter the world of rapid talk, which was alone\r\nfamiliar to her.\r\n\r\n“Were you snubbed?” asked his son tranquilly.\r\n\r\n“But we have spoilt the pleasure of I don’t know how many people. They\r\nwon’t come back.”\r\n\r\n“...full of innate sympathy...quickness to perceive good in\r\nothers...vision of the brotherhood of man...” Scraps of the lecture on\r\nSt. Francis came floating round the partition wall.\r\n\r\n“Don’t let us spoil yours,” he continued to Lucy. “Have you looked at\r\nthose saints?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Lucy. “They are lovely. Do you know which is the tombstone\r\nthat is praised in Ruskin?”\r\n\r\nHe did not know, and suggested that they should try to guess it.\r\nGeorge, rather to her relief, refused to move, and she and the old man\r\nwandered not unpleasantly about Santa Croce, which, though it is like a\r\nbarn, has harvested many beautiful things inside its walls. There were\r\nalso beggars to avoid and guides to dodge round the pillars, and an old\r\nlady with her dog, and here and there a priest modestly edging to his\r\nMass through the groups of tourists. But Mr. Emerson was only half\r\ninterested. He watched the lecturer, whose success he believed he had\r\nimpaired, and then he anxiously watched his son.\r\n\r\n“Why will he look at that fresco?” he said uneasily. “I saw nothing in\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“I like Giotto,” she replied. “It is so wonderful what they say about\r\nhis tactile values. Though I like things like the Della Robbia babies\r\nbetter.”\r\n\r\n“So you ought. A baby is worth a dozen saints. And my baby’s worth the\r\nwhole of Paradise, and as far as I can see he lives in Hell.”\r\n\r\nLucy again felt that this did not do.\r\n\r\n“In Hell,” he repeated. “He’s unhappy.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear!” said Lucy.\r\n\r\n“How can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive? What more is one to\r\ngive him? And think how he has been brought up—free from all the\r\nsuperstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the\r\nname of God. With such an education as that, I thought he was bound to\r\ngrow up happy.”\r\n\r\nShe was no theologian, but she felt that here was a very foolish old\r\nman, as well as a very irreligious one. She also felt that her mother\r\nmight not like her talking to that kind of person, and that Charlotte\r\nwould object most strongly.\r\n\r\n“What are we to do with him?” he asked. “He comes out for his holiday\r\nto Italy, and behaves—like that; like the little child who ought to\r\nhave been playing, and who hurt himself upon the tombstone. Eh? What\r\ndid you say?”\r\n\r\nLucy had made no suggestion. Suddenly he said:\r\n\r\n“Now don’t be stupid over this. I don’t require you to fall in love\r\nwith my boy, but I do think you might try and understand him. You are\r\nnearer his age, and if you let yourself go I am sure you are sensible.\r\nYou might help me. He has known so few women, and you have the time.\r\nYou stop here several weeks, I suppose? But let yourself go. You are\r\ninclined to get muddled, if I may judge from last night. Let yourself\r\ngo. Pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand,\r\nand spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them. By\r\nunderstanding George you may learn to understand yourself. It will be\r\ngood for both of you.”\r\n\r\nTo this extraordinary speech Lucy found no answer.\r\n\r\n“I only know what it is that’s wrong with him; not why it is.”\r\n\r\n“And what is it?” asked Lucy fearfully, expecting some harrowing tale.\r\n\r\n“The old trouble; things won’t fit.”\r\n\r\n“What things?”\r\n\r\n“The things of the universe. It is quite true. They don’t.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Emerson, whatever do you mean?”\r\n\r\nIn his ordinary voice, so that she scarcely realized he was quoting\r\npoetry, he said:\r\n\r\n“‘From far, from eve and morning,\r\n    And yon twelve-winded sky,\r\nThe stuff of life to knit me\r\n    Blew hither: here am I’\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge and I both know this, but why does it distress him? We know that\r\nwe come from the winds, and that we shall return to them; that all life\r\nis perhaps a knot, a tangle, a blemish in the eternal smoothness. But\r\nwhy should this make us unhappy? Let us rather love one another, and\r\nwork and rejoice. I don’t believe in this world sorrow.”\r\n\r\nMiss Honeychurch assented.\r\n\r\n“Then make my boy think like us. Make him realize that by the side of\r\nthe everlasting Why there is a Yes—a transitory Yes if you like, but a\r\nYes.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly she laughed; surely one ought to laugh. A young man melancholy\r\nbecause the universe wouldn’t fit, because life was a tangle or a wind,\r\nor a Yes, or something!\r\n\r\n“I’m very sorry,” she cried. “You’ll think me unfeeling, but—but—” Then\r\nshe became matronly. “Oh, but your son wants employment. Has he no\r\nparticular hobby? Why, I myself have worries, but I can generally\r\nforget them at the piano; and collecting stamps did no end of good for\r\nmy brother. Perhaps Italy bores him; you ought to try the Alps or the\r\nLakes.”\r\n\r\nThe old man’s face saddened, and he touched her gently with his hand.\r\nThis did not alarm her; she thought that her advice had impressed him\r\nand that he was thanking her for it. Indeed, he no longer alarmed her\r\nat all; she regarded him as a kind thing, but quite silly. Her feelings\r\nwere as inflated spiritually as they had been an hour ago esthetically,\r\nbefore she lost Baedeker. The dear George, now striding towards them\r\nover the tombstones, seemed both pitiable and absurd. He approached,\r\nhis face in the shadow. He said:\r\n\r\n“Miss Bartlett.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, good gracious me!” said Lucy, suddenly collapsing and again seeing\r\nthe whole of life in a new perspective. “Where? Where?”\r\n\r\n“In the nave.”\r\n\r\n“I see. Those gossiping little Miss Alans must have—” She checked\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n“Poor girl!” exploded Mr. Emerson. “Poor girl!”\r\n\r\nShe could not let this pass, for it was just what she was feeling\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n“Poor girl? I fail to understand the point of that remark. I think\r\nmyself a very fortunate girl, I assure you. I’m thoroughly happy, and\r\nhaving a splendid time. Pray don’t waste time mourning over _me_.\r\nThere’s enough sorrow in the world, isn’t there, without trying to\r\ninvent it. Good-bye. Thank you both so much for all your kindness. Ah,\r\nyes! there does come my cousin. A delightful morning! Santa Croce is a\r\nwonderful church.”\r\n\r\nShe joined her cousin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\nMusic, Violets, and the Letter “S”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt so happened that Lucy, who found daily life rather chaotic, entered\r\na more solid world when she opened the piano. She was then no longer\r\neither deferential or patronizing; no longer either a rebel or a slave.\r\nThe kingdom of music is not the kingdom of this world; it will accept\r\nthose whom breeding and intellect and culture have alike rejected. The\r\ncommonplace person begins to play, and shoots into the empyrean without\r\neffort, whilst we look up, marvelling how he has escaped us, and\r\nthinking how we could worship him and love him, would he but translate\r\nhis visions into human words, and his experiences into human actions.\r\nPerhaps he cannot; certainly he does not, or does so very seldom. Lucy\r\nhad done so never.\r\n\r\nShe was no dazzling _exécutante;_ her runs were not at all like strings\r\nof pearls, and she struck no more right notes than was suitable for one\r\nof her age and situation. Nor was she the passionate young lady, who\r\nperforms so tragically on a summer’s evening with the window open.\r\nPassion was there, but it could not be easily labelled; it slipped\r\nbetween love and hatred and jealousy, and all the furniture of the\r\npictorial style. And she was tragical only in the sense that she was\r\ngreat, for she loved to play on the side of Victory. Victory of what\r\nand over what—that is more than the words of daily life can tell us.\r\nBut that some sonatas of Beethoven are written tragic no one can\r\ngainsay; yet they can triumph or despair as the player decides, and\r\nLucy had decided that they should triumph.\r\n\r\nA very wet afternoon at the Bertolini permitted her to do the thing she\r\nreally liked, and after lunch she opened the little draped piano. A few\r\npeople lingered round and praised her playing, but finding that she\r\nmade no reply, dispersed to their rooms to write up their diaries or to\r\nsleep. She took no notice of Mr. Emerson looking for his son, nor of\r\nMiss Bartlett looking for Miss Lavish, nor of Miss Lavish looking for\r\nher cigarette-case. Like every true performer, she was intoxicated by\r\nthe mere feel of the notes: they were fingers caressing her own; and by\r\ntouch, not by sound alone, did she come to her desire.\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe, sitting unnoticed in the window, pondered this illogical\r\nelement in Miss Honeychurch, and recalled the occasion at Tunbridge\r\nWells when he had discovered it. It was at one of those entertainments\r\nwhere the upper classes entertain the lower. The seats were filled with\r\na respectful audience, and the ladies and gentlemen of the parish,\r\nunder the auspices of their vicar, sang, or recited, or imitated the\r\ndrawing of a champagne cork. Among the promised items was “Miss\r\nHoneychurch. Piano. Beethoven,” and Mr. Beebe was wondering whether it\r\nwould be Adelaida, or the march of The Ruins of Athens, when his\r\ncomposure was disturbed by the opening bars of Opus 111. He was in\r\nsuspense all through the introduction, for not until the pace quickens\r\ndoes one know what the performer intends. With the roar of the opening\r\ntheme he knew that things were going extraordinarily; in the chords\r\nthat herald the conclusion he heard the hammer strokes of victory. He\r\nwas glad that she only played the first movement, for he could have\r\npaid no attention to the winding intricacies of the measures of\r\nnine-sixteen. The audience clapped, no less respectful. It was Mr.\r\nBeebe who started the stamping; it was all that one could do.\r\n\r\n“Who is she?” he asked the vicar afterwards.\r\n\r\n“Cousin of one of my parishioners. I do not consider her choice of a\r\npiece happy. Beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal\r\nthat it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that, which, if\r\nanything, disturbs.”\r\n\r\n“Introduce me.”\r\n\r\n“She will be delighted. She and Miss Bartlett are full of the praises\r\nof your sermon.”\r\n\r\n“My sermon?” cried Mr. Beebe. “Why ever did she listen to it?”\r\n\r\nWhen he was introduced he understood why, for Miss Honeychurch,\r\ndisjoined from her music stool, was only a young lady with a quantity\r\nof dark hair and a very pretty, pale, undeveloped face. She loved going\r\nto concerts, she loved stopping with her cousin, she loved iced coffee\r\nand meringues. He did not doubt that she loved his sermon also. But\r\nbefore he left Tunbridge Wells he made a remark to the vicar, which he\r\nnow made to Lucy herself when she closed the little piano and moved\r\ndreamily towards him:\r\n\r\n“If Miss Honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays, it will be very\r\nexciting both for us and for her.”\r\n\r\nLucy at once re-entered daily life.\r\n\r\n“Oh, what a funny thing! Some one said just the same to mother, and she\r\nsaid she trusted I should never live a duet.”\r\n\r\n“Doesn’t Mrs. Honeychurch like music?”\r\n\r\n“She doesn’t mind it. But she doesn’t like one to get excited over\r\nanything; she thinks I am silly about it. She thinks—I can’t make out.\r\nOnce, you know, I said that I liked my own playing better than any\r\none’s. She has never got over it. Of course, I didn’t mean that I\r\nplayed well; I only meant—”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said he, wondering why she bothered to explain.\r\n\r\n“Music—” said Lucy, as if attempting some generality. She could not\r\ncomplete it, and looked out absently upon Italy in the wet. The whole\r\nlife of the South was disorganized, and the most graceful nation in\r\nEurope had turned into formless lumps of clothes.\r\n\r\nThe street and the river were dirty yellow, the bridge was dirty grey,\r\nand the hills were dirty purple. Somewhere in their folds were\r\nconcealed Miss Lavish and Miss Bartlett, who had chosen this afternoon\r\nto visit the Torre del Gallo.\r\n\r\n“What about music?” said Mr. Beebe.\r\n\r\n“Poor Charlotte will be sopped,” was Lucy’s reply.\r\n\r\nThe expedition was typical of Miss Bartlett, who would return cold,\r\ntired, hungry, and angelic, with a ruined skirt, a pulpy Baedeker, and\r\na tickling cough in her throat. On another day, when the whole world\r\nwas singing and the air ran into the mouth, like wine, she would refuse\r\nto stir from the drawing-room, saying that she was an old thing, and no\r\nfit companion for a hearty girl.\r\n\r\n“Miss Lavish has led your cousin astray. She hopes to find the true\r\nItaly in the wet I believe.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Lavish is so original,” murmured Lucy. This was a stock remark,\r\nthe supreme achievement of the Pension Bertolini in the way of\r\ndefinition. Miss Lavish was so original. Mr. Beebe had his doubts, but\r\nthey would have been put down to clerical narrowness. For that, and for\r\nother reasons, he held his peace.\r\n\r\n“Is it true,” continued Lucy in awe-struck tone, “that Miss Lavish is\r\nwriting a book?”\r\n\r\n“They do say so.”\r\n\r\n“What is it about?”\r\n\r\n“It will be a novel,” replied Mr. Beebe, “dealing with modern Italy.\r\nLet me refer you for an account to Miss Catharine Alan, who uses words\r\nherself more admirably than any one I know.”\r\n\r\n“I wish Miss Lavish would tell me herself. We started such friends. But\r\nI don’t think she ought to have run away with Baedeker that morning in\r\nSanta Croce. Charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically\r\nalone, and so I couldn’t help being a little annoyed with Miss Lavish.”\r\n\r\n“The two ladies, at all events, have made it up.”\r\n\r\nHe was interested in the sudden friendship between women so apparently\r\ndissimilar as Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish. They were always in each\r\nother’s company, with Lucy a slighted third. Miss Lavish he believed he\r\nunderstood, but Miss Bartlett might reveal unknown depths of\r\nstrangeness, though not perhaps, of meaning. Was Italy deflecting her\r\nfrom the path of prim chaperon, which he had assigned to her at\r\nTunbridge Wells? All his life he had loved to study maiden ladies; they\r\nwere his specialty, and his profession had provided him with ample\r\nopportunities for the work. Girls like Lucy were charming to look at,\r\nbut Mr. Beebe was, from rather profound reasons, somewhat chilly in his\r\nattitude towards the other sex, and preferred to be interested rather\r\nthan enthralled.\r\n\r\nLucy, for the third time, said that poor Charlotte would be sopped. The\r\nArno was rising in flood, washing away the traces of the little carts\r\nupon the foreshore. But in the south-west there had appeared a dull\r\nhaze of yellow, which might mean better weather if it did not mean\r\nworse. She opened the window to inspect, and a cold blast entered the\r\nroom, drawing a plaintive cry from Miss Catharine Alan, who entered at\r\nthe same moment by the door.\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear Miss Honeychurch, you will catch a chill! And Mr. Beebe here\r\nbesides. Who would suppose this is Italy? There is my sister actually\r\nnursing the hot-water can; no comforts or proper provisions.”\r\n\r\nShe sidled towards them and sat down, self-conscious as she always was\r\non entering a room which contained one man, or a man and one woman.\r\n\r\n“I could hear your beautiful playing, Miss Honeychurch, though I was in\r\nmy room with the door shut. Doors shut; indeed, most necessary. No one\r\nhas the least idea of privacy in this country. And one person catches\r\nit from another.”\r\n\r\nLucy answered suitably. Mr. Beebe was not able to tell the ladies of\r\nhis adventure at Modena, where the chambermaid burst in upon him in his\r\nbath, exclaiming cheerfully, “Fa niente, sono vecchia.” He contented\r\nhimself with saying: “I quite agree with you, Miss Alan. The Italians\r\nare a most unpleasant people. They pry everywhere, they see everything,\r\nand they know what we want before we know it ourselves. We are at their\r\nmercy. They read our thoughts, they foretell our desires. From the\r\ncab-driver down to—to Giotto, they turn us inside out, and I resent it.\r\nYet in their heart of hearts they are—how superficial! They have no\r\nconception of the intellectual life. How right is Signora Bertolini,\r\nwho exclaimed to me the other day: ‘Ho, Mr. Beebe, if you knew what I\r\nsuffer over the children’s edjucaishion. _Hi_ won’t ’ave my little\r\nVictorier taught by a hignorant Italian what can’t explain nothink!’”\r\n\r\nMiss Alan did not follow, but gathered that she was being mocked in an\r\nagreeable way. Her sister was a little disappointed in Mr. Beebe,\r\nhaving expected better things from a clergyman whose head was bald and\r\nwho wore a pair of russet whiskers. Indeed, who would have supposed\r\nthat tolerance, sympathy, and a sense of humour would inhabit that\r\nmilitant form?\r\n\r\nIn the midst of her satisfaction she continued to sidle, and at last\r\nthe cause was disclosed. From the chair beneath her she extracted a\r\ngun-metal cigarette-case, on which were powdered in turquoise the\r\ninitials “E. L.”\r\n\r\n“That belongs to Lavish.” said the clergyman. “A good fellow, Lavish,\r\nbut I wish she’d start a pipe.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Beebe,” said Miss Alan, divided between awe and mirth.\r\n“Indeed, though it is dreadful for her to smoke, it is not quite as\r\ndreadful as you suppose. She took to it, practically in despair, after\r\nher life’s work was carried away in a landslip. Surely that makes it\r\nmore excusable.”\r\n\r\n“What was that?” asked Lucy.\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe sat back complacently, and Miss Alan began as follows: “It\r\nwas a novel—and I am afraid, from what I can gather, not a very nice\r\nnovel. It is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them, and I\r\nmust say they nearly always do. Anyhow, she left it almost finished in\r\nthe Grotto of the Calvary at the Capuccini Hotel at Amalfi while she\r\nwent for a little ink. She said: ‘Can I have a little ink, please?’ But\r\nyou know what Italians are, and meanwhile the Grotto fell roaring on to\r\nthe beach, and the saddest thing of all is that she cannot remember\r\nwhat she has written. The poor thing was very ill after it, and so got\r\ntempted into cigarettes. It is a great secret, but I am glad to say\r\nthat she is writing another novel. She told Teresa and Miss Pole the\r\nother day that she had got up all the local colour—this novel is to be\r\nabout modern Italy; the other was historical—but that she could not\r\nstart till she had an idea. First she tried Perugia for an inspiration,\r\nthen she came here—this must on no account get round. And so cheerful\r\nthrough it all! I cannot help thinking that there is something to\r\nadmire in everyone, even if you do not approve of them.”\r\n\r\nMiss Alan was always thus being charitable against her better\r\njudgement. A delicate pathos perfumed her disconnected remarks, giving\r\nthem unexpected beauty, just as in the decaying autumn woods there\r\nsometimes rise odours reminiscent of spring. She felt she had made\r\nalmost too many allowances, and apologized hurriedly for her\r\ntoleration.\r\n\r\n“All the same, she is a little too—I hardly like to say unwomanly, but\r\nshe behaved most strangely when the Emersons arrived.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe smiled as Miss Alan plunged into an anecdote which he knew\r\nshe would be unable to finish in the presence of a gentleman.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know, Miss Honeychurch, if you have noticed that Miss Pole,\r\nthe lady who has so much yellow hair, takes lemonade. That old Mr.\r\nEmerson, who puts things very strangely—”\r\n\r\nHer jaw dropped. She was silent. Mr. Beebe, whose social resources were\r\nendless, went out to order some tea, and she continued to Lucy in a\r\nhasty whisper:\r\n\r\n“Stomach. He warned Miss Pole of her stomach-acidity, he called it—and\r\nhe may have meant to be kind. I must say I forgot myself and laughed;\r\nit was so sudden. As Teresa truly said, it was no laughing matter. But\r\nthe point is that Miss Lavish was positively _attracted_ by his\r\nmentioning S., and said she liked plain speaking, and meeting different\r\ngrades of thought. She thought they were commercial\r\ntravellers—‘drummers’ was the word she used—and all through dinner she\r\ntried to prove that England, our great and beloved country, rests on\r\nnothing but commerce. Teresa was very much annoyed, and left the table\r\nbefore the cheese, saying as she did so: ‘There, Miss Lavish, is one\r\nwho can confute you better than I,’ and pointed to that beautiful\r\npicture of Lord Tennyson. Then Miss Lavish said: ‘Tut! The early\r\nVictorians.’ Just imagine! ‘Tut! The early Victorians.’ My sister had\r\ngone, and I felt bound to speak. I said: ‘Miss Lavish, _I_ am an early\r\nVictorian; at least, that is to say, I will hear no breath of censure\r\nagainst our dear Queen.’ It was horrible speaking. I reminded her how\r\nthe Queen had been to Ireland when she did not want to go, and I must\r\nsay she was dumbfounded, and made no reply. But, unluckily, Mr. Emerson\r\noverheard this part, and called in his deep voice: ‘Quite so, quite so!\r\nI honour the woman for her Irish visit.’ The woman! I tell things so\r\nbadly; but you see what a tangle we were in by this time, all on\r\naccount of S. having been mentioned in the first place. But that was\r\nnot all. After dinner Miss Lavish actually came up and said: ‘Miss\r\nAlan, I am going into the smoking-room to talk to those two nice men.\r\nCome, too.’ Needless to say, I refused such an unsuitable invitation,\r\nand she had the impertinence to tell me that it would broaden my ideas,\r\nand said that she had four brothers, all University men, except one who\r\nwas in the army, who always made a point of talking to commercial\r\ntravellers.”\r\n\r\n“Let me finish the story,” said Mr. Beebe, who had returned.\r\n\r\n“Miss Lavish tried Miss Pole, myself, everyone, and finally said: ‘I\r\nshall go alone.’ She went. At the end of five minutes she returned\r\nunobtrusively with a green baize board, and began playing patience.”\r\n\r\n“Whatever happened?” cried Lucy.\r\n\r\n“No one knows. No one will ever know. Miss Lavish will never dare to\r\ntell, and Mr. Emerson does not think it worth telling.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Beebe—old Mr. Emerson, is he nice or not nice? I do so want to\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe laughed and suggested that she should settle the question for\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n“No; but it is so difficult. Sometimes he is so silly, and then I do\r\nnot mind him. Miss Alan, what do you think? Is he nice?”\r\n\r\nThe little old lady shook her head, and sighed disapprovingly. Mr.\r\nBeebe, whom the conversation amused, stirred her up by saying:\r\n\r\n“I consider that you are bound to class him as nice, Miss Alan, after\r\nthat business of the violets.”\r\n\r\n“Violets? Oh, dear! Who told you about the violets? How do things get\r\nround? A pension is a bad place for gossips. No, I cannot forget how\r\nthey behaved at Mr. Eager’s lecture at Santa Croce. Oh, poor Miss\r\nHoneychurch! It really was too bad. No, I have quite changed. I do\r\n_not_ like the Emersons. They are _not_ nice.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe smiled nonchalantly. He had made a gentle effort to introduce\r\nthe Emersons into Bertolini society, and the effort had failed. He was\r\nalmost the only person who remained friendly to them. Miss Lavish, who\r\nrepresented intellect, was avowedly hostile, and now the Miss Alans,\r\nwho stood for good breeding, were following her. Miss Bartlett,\r\nsmarting under an obligation, would scarcely be civil. The case of Lucy\r\nwas different. She had given him a hazy account of her adventures in\r\nSanta Croce, and he gathered that the two men had made a curious and\r\npossibly concerted attempt to annex her, to show her the world from\r\ntheir own strange standpoint, to interest her in their private sorrows\r\nand joys. This was impertinent; he did not wish their cause to be\r\nchampioned by a young girl: he would rather it should fail. After all,\r\nhe knew nothing about them, and pension joys, pension sorrows, are\r\nflimsy things; whereas Lucy would be his parishioner.\r\n\r\nLucy, with one eye upon the weather, finally said that she thought the\r\nEmersons were nice; not that she saw anything of them now. Even their\r\nseats at dinner had been moved.\r\n\r\n“But aren’t they always waylaying you to go out with them, dear?” said\r\nthe little lady inquisitively.\r\n\r\n“Only once. Charlotte didn’t like it, and said something—quite\r\npolitely, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Most right of her. They don’t understand our ways. They must find\r\ntheir level.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe rather felt that they had gone under. They had given up their\r\nattempt—if it was one—to conquer society, and now the father was almost\r\nas silent as the son. He wondered whether he would not plan a pleasant\r\nday for these folk before they left—some expedition, perhaps, with Lucy\r\nwell chaperoned to be nice to them. It was one of Mr. Beebe’s chief\r\npleasures to provide people with happy memories.\r\n\r\nEvening approached while they chatted; the air became brighter; the\r\ncolours on the trees and hills were purified, and the Arno lost its\r\nmuddy solidity and began to twinkle. There were a few streaks of\r\nbluish-green among the clouds, a few patches of watery light upon the\r\nearth, and then the dripping façade of San Miniato shone brilliantly in\r\nthe declining sun.\r\n\r\n“Too late to go out,” said Miss Alan in a voice of relief. “All the\r\ngalleries are shut.”\r\n\r\n“I think I shall go out,” said Lucy. “I want to go round the town in\r\nthe circular tram—on the platform by the driver.”\r\n\r\nHer two companions looked grave. Mr. Beebe, who felt responsible for\r\nher in the absence of Miss Bartlett, ventured to say:\r\n\r\n“I wish we could. Unluckily I have letters. If you do want to go out\r\nalone, won’t you be better on your feet?”\r\n\r\n“Italians, dear, you know,” said Miss Alan.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I shall meet someone who reads me through and through!”\r\n\r\nBut they still looked disapproval, and she so far conceded to Mr. Beebe\r\nas to say that she would only go for a little walk, and keep to the\r\nstreet frequented by tourists.\r\n\r\n“She oughtn’t really to go at all,” said Mr. Beebe, as they watched her\r\nfrom the window, “and she knows it. I put it down to too much\r\nBeethoven.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\nFourth Chapter\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe was right. Lucy never knew her desires so clearly as after\r\nmusic. She had not really appreciated the clergyman’s wit, nor the\r\nsuggestive twitterings of Miss Alan. Conversation was tedious; she\r\nwanted something big, and she believed that it would have come to her\r\non the wind-swept platform of an electric tram. This she might not\r\nattempt. It was unladylike. Why? Why were most big things unladylike?\r\nCharlotte had once explained to her why. It was not that ladies were\r\ninferior to men; it was that they were different. Their mission was to\r\ninspire others to achievement rather than to achieve themselves.\r\nIndirectly, by means of tact and a spotless name, a lady could\r\naccomplish much. But if she rushed into the fray herself she would be\r\nfirst censured, then despised, and finally ignored. Poems had been\r\nwritten to illustrate this point.\r\n\r\nThere is much that is immortal in this medieval lady. The dragons have\r\ngone, and so have the knights, but still she lingers in our midst. She\r\nreigned in many an early Victorian castle, and was Queen of much early\r\nVictorian song. It is sweet to protect her in the intervals of\r\nbusiness, sweet to pay her honour when she has cooked our dinner well.\r\nBut alas! the creature grows degenerate. In her heart also there are\r\nspringing up strange desires. She too is enamoured of heavy winds, and\r\nvast panoramas, and green expanses of the sea. She has marked the\r\nkingdom of this world, how full it is of wealth, and beauty, and war—a\r\nradiant crust, built around the central fires, spinning towards the\r\nreceding heavens. Men, declaring that she inspires them to it, move\r\njoyfully over the surface, having the most delightful meetings with\r\nother men, happy, not because they are masculine, but because they are\r\nalive. Before the show breaks up she would like to drop the august\r\ntitle of the Eternal Woman, and go there as her transitory self.\r\n\r\nLucy does not stand for the medieval lady, who was rather an ideal to\r\nwhich she was bidden to lift her eyes when feeling serious. Nor has she\r\nany system of revolt. Here and there a restriction annoyed her\r\nparticularly, and she would transgress it, and perhaps be sorry that\r\nshe had done so. This afternoon she was peculiarly restive. She would\r\nreally like to do something of which her well-wishers disapproved. As\r\nshe might not go on the electric tram, she went to Alinari’s shop.\r\n\r\nThere she bought a photograph of Botticelli’s “Birth of Venus.” Venus,\r\nbeing a pity, spoilt the picture, otherwise so charming, and Miss\r\nBartlett had persuaded her to do without it. (A pity in art of course\r\nsignified the nude.) Giorgione’s “Tempesta,” the “Idolino,” some of the\r\nSistine frescoes and the Apoxyomenos, were added to it. She felt a\r\nlittle calmer then, and bought Fra Angelico’s “Coronation,” Giotto’s\r\n“Ascension of St. John,” some Della Robbia babies, and some Guido Reni\r\nMadonnas. For her taste was catholic, and she extended uncritical\r\napproval to every well-known name.\r\n\r\nBut though she spent nearly seven lire, the gates of liberty seemed\r\nstill unopened. She was conscious of her discontent; it was new to her\r\nto be conscious of it. “The world,” she thought, “is certainly full of\r\nbeautiful things, if only I could come across them.” It was not\r\nsurprising that Mrs. Honeychurch disapproved of music, declaring that\r\nit always left her daughter peevish, unpractical, and touchy.\r\n\r\n“Nothing ever happens to me,” she reflected, as she entered the Piazza\r\nSignoria and looked nonchalantly at its marvels, now fairly familiar to\r\nher. The great square was in shadow; the sunshine had come too late to\r\nstrike it. Neptune was already unsubstantial in the twilight, half god,\r\nhalf ghost, and his fountain plashed dreamily to the men and satyrs who\r\nidled together on its marge. The Loggia showed as the triple entrance\r\nof a cave, wherein many a deity, shadowy, but immortal, looking forth\r\nupon the arrivals and departures of mankind. It was the hour of\r\nunreality—the hour, that is, when unfamiliar things are real. An older\r\nperson at such an hour and in such a place might think that sufficient\r\nwas happening to him, and rest content. Lucy desired more.\r\n\r\nShe fixed her eyes wistfully on the tower of the palace, which rose out\r\nof the lower darkness like a pillar of roughened gold. It seemed no\r\nlonger a tower, no longer supported by earth, but some unattainable\r\ntreasure throbbing in the tranquil sky. Its brightness mesmerized her,\r\nstill dancing before her eyes when she bent them to the ground and\r\nstarted towards home.\r\n\r\nThen something did happen.\r\n\r\nTwo Italians by the Loggia had been bickering about a debt. “Cinque\r\nlire,” they had cried, “cinque lire!” They sparred at each other, and\r\none of them was hit lightly upon the chest. He frowned; he bent towards\r\nLucy with a look of interest, as if he had an important message for\r\nher. He opened his lips to deliver it, and a stream of red came out\r\nbetween them and trickled down his unshaven chin.\r\n\r\nThat was all. A crowd rose out of the dusk. It hid this extraordinary\r\nman from her, and bore him away to the fountain. Mr. George Emerson\r\nhappened to be a few paces away, looking at her across the spot where\r\nthe man had been. How very odd! Across something. Even as she caught\r\nsight of him he grew dim; the palace itself grew dim, swayed above her,\r\nfell on to her softly, slowly, noiselessly, and the sky fell with it.\r\n\r\nShe thought: “Oh, what have I done?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, what have I done?” she murmured, and opened her eyes.\r\n\r\nGeorge Emerson still looked at her, but not across anything. She had\r\ncomplained of dullness, and lo! one man was stabbed, and another held\r\nher in his arms.\r\n\r\nThey were sitting on some steps in the Uffizi Arcade. He must have\r\ncarried her. He rose when she spoke, and began to dust his knees. She\r\nrepeated:\r\n\r\n“Oh, what have I done?”\r\n\r\n“You fainted.”\r\n\r\n“I—I am very sorry.”\r\n\r\n“How are you now?”\r\n\r\n“Perfectly well—absolutely well.” And she began to nod and smile.\r\n\r\n“Then let us come home. There’s no point in our stopping.”\r\n\r\nHe held out his hand to pull her up. She pretended not to see it. The\r\ncries from the fountain—they had never ceased—rang emptily. The whole\r\nworld seemed pale and void of its original meaning.\r\n\r\n“How very kind you have been! I might have hurt myself falling. But now\r\nI am well. I can go alone, thank you.”\r\n\r\nHis hand was still extended.\r\n\r\n“Oh, my photographs!” she exclaimed suddenly.\r\n\r\n“What photographs?”\r\n\r\n“I bought some photographs at Alinari’s. I must have dropped them out\r\nthere in the square.” She looked at him cautiously. “Would you add to\r\nyour kindness by fetching them?”\r\n\r\nHe added to his kindness. As soon as he had turned his back, Lucy arose\r\nwith the running of a maniac and stole down the arcade towards the\r\nArno.\r\n\r\n“Miss Honeychurch!”\r\n\r\nShe stopped with her hand on her heart.\r\n\r\n“You sit still; you aren’t fit to go home alone.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am, thank you so very much.”\r\n\r\n“No, you aren’t. You’d go openly if you were.”\r\n\r\n“But I had rather—”\r\n\r\n“Then I don’t fetch your photographs.”\r\n\r\n“I had rather be alone.”\r\n\r\nHe said imperiously: “The man is dead—the man is probably dead; sit\r\ndown till you are rested.” She was bewildered, and obeyed him. “And\r\ndon’t move till I come back.”\r\n\r\nIn the distance she saw creatures with black hoods, such as appear in\r\ndreams. The palace tower had lost the reflection of the declining day,\r\nand joined itself to earth. How should she talk to Mr. Emerson when he\r\nreturned from the shadowy square? Again the thought occurred to her,\r\n“Oh, what have I done?”—the thought that she, as well as the dying man,\r\nhad crossed some spiritual boundary.\r\n\r\nHe returned, and she talked of the murder. Oddly enough, it was an easy\r\ntopic. She spoke of the Italian character; she became almost garrulous\r\nover the incident that had made her faint five minutes before. Being\r\nstrong physically, she soon overcame the horror of blood. She rose\r\nwithout his assistance, and though wings seemed to flutter inside her,\r\nshe walked firmly enough towards the Arno. There a cabman signalled to\r\nthem; they refused him.\r\n\r\n“And the murderer tried to kiss him, you say—how very odd Italians\r\nare!—and gave himself up to the police! Mr. Beebe was saying that\r\nItalians know everything, but I think they are rather childish. When my\r\ncousin and I were at the Pitti yesterday—What was that?”\r\n\r\nHe had thrown something into the stream.\r\n\r\n“What did you throw in?”\r\n\r\n“Things I didn’t want,” he said crossly.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Emerson!”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“Where are the photographs?”\r\n\r\nHe was silent.\r\n\r\n“I believe it was my photographs that you threw away.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know what to do with them,” he cried, and his voice was that\r\nof an anxious boy. Her heart warmed towards him for the first time.\r\n“They were covered with blood. There! I’m glad I’ve told you; and all\r\nthe time we were making conversation I was wondering what to do with\r\nthem.” He pointed down-stream. “They’ve gone.” The river swirled under\r\nthe bridge, “I did mind them so, and one is so foolish, it seemed\r\nbetter that they should go out to the sea—I don’t know; I may just mean\r\nthat they frightened me.” Then the boy verged into a man. “For\r\nsomething tremendous has happened; I must face it without getting\r\nmuddled. It isn’t exactly that a man has died.”\r\n\r\nSomething warned Lucy that she must stop him.\r\n\r\n“It has happened,” he repeated, “and I mean to find out what it is.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Emerson—”\r\n\r\nHe turned towards her frowning, as if she had disturbed him in some\r\nabstract quest.\r\n\r\n“I want to ask you something before we go in.”\r\n\r\nThey were close to their pension. She stopped and leant her elbows\r\nagainst the parapet of the embankment. He did likewise. There is at\r\ntimes a magic in identity of position; it is one of the things that\r\nhave suggested to us eternal comradeship. She moved her elbows before\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n“I have behaved ridiculously.”\r\n\r\nHe was following his own thoughts.\r\n\r\n“I was never so much ashamed of myself in my life; I cannot think what\r\ncame over me.”\r\n\r\n“I nearly fainted myself,” he said; but she felt that her attitude\r\nrepelled him.\r\n\r\n“Well, I owe you a thousand apologies.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, all right.”\r\n\r\n“And—this is the real point—you know how silly people are\r\ngossiping—ladies especially, I am afraid—you understand what I mean?”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid I don’t.”\r\n\r\n“I mean, would you not mention it to any one, my foolish behaviour?”\r\n\r\n“Your behaviour? Oh, yes, all right—all right.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you so much. And would you—”\r\n\r\nShe could not carry her request any further. The river was rushing\r\nbelow them, almost black in the advancing night. He had thrown her\r\nphotographs into it, and then he had told her the reason. It struck her\r\nthat it was hopeless to look for chivalry in such a man. He would do\r\nher no harm by idle gossip; he was trustworthy, intelligent, and even\r\nkind; he might even have a high opinion of her. But he lacked chivalry;\r\nhis thoughts, like his behaviour, would not be modified by awe. It was\r\nuseless to say to him, “And would you—” and hope that he would complete\r\nthe sentence for himself, averting his eyes from her nakedness like the\r\nknight in that beautiful picture. She had been in his arms, and he\r\nremembered it, just as he remembered the blood on the photographs that\r\nshe had bought in Alinari’s shop. It was not exactly that a man had\r\ndied; something had happened to the living: they had come to a\r\nsituation where character tells, and where childhood enters upon the\r\nbranching paths of Youth.\r\n\r\n“Well, thank you so much,” she repeated, “How quickly these accidents\r\ndo happen, and then one returns to the old life!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t.”\r\n\r\nAnxiety moved her to question him.\r\n\r\nHis answer was puzzling: “I shall probably want to live.”\r\n\r\n“But why, Mr. Emerson? What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I shall want to live, I say.”\r\n\r\nLeaning her elbows on the parapet, she contemplated the River Arno,\r\nwhose roar was suggesting some unexpected melody to her ears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V\r\nPossibilities of a Pleasant Outing\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a family saying that “you never knew which way Charlotte\r\nBartlett would turn.” She was perfectly pleasant and sensible over\r\nLucy’s adventure, found the abridged account of it quite adequate, and\r\npaid suitable tribute to the courtesy of Mr. George Emerson. She and\r\nMiss Lavish had had an adventure also. They had been stopped at the\r\nDazio coming back, and the young officials there, who seemed impudent\r\nand _désœuvré_, had tried to search their reticules for provisions. It\r\nmight have been most unpleasant. Fortunately Miss Lavish was a match\r\nfor any one.\r\n\r\nFor good or for evil, Lucy was left to face her problem alone. None of\r\nher friends had seen her, either in the Piazza or, later on, by the\r\nembankment. Mr. Beebe, indeed, noticing her startled eyes at\r\ndinner-time, had again passed to himself the remark of “Too much\r\nBeethoven.” But he only supposed that she was ready for an adventure,\r\nnot that she had encountered it. This solitude oppressed her; she was\r\naccustomed to have her thoughts confirmed by others or, at all events,\r\ncontradicted; it was too dreadful not to know whether she was thinking\r\nright or wrong.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast next morning she took decisive action. There were two\r\nplans between which she had to choose. Mr. Beebe was walking up to the\r\nTorre del Gallo with the Emersons and some American ladies. Would Miss\r\nBartlett and Miss Honeychurch join the party? Charlotte declined for\r\nherself; she had been there in the rain the previous afternoon. But she\r\nthought it an admirable idea for Lucy, who hated shopping, changing\r\nmoney, fetching letters, and other irksome duties—all of which Miss\r\nBartlett must accomplish this morning and could easily accomplish\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n“No, Charlotte!” cried the girl, with real warmth. “It’s very kind of\r\nMr. Beebe, but I am certainly coming with you. I had much rather.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, dear,” said Miss Bartlett, with a faint flush of pleasure\r\nthat called forth a deep flush of shame on the cheeks of Lucy. How\r\nabominably she behaved to Charlotte, now as always! But now she should\r\nalter. All morning she would be really nice to her.\r\n\r\nShe slipped her arm into her cousin’s, and they started off along the\r\nLung’ Arno. The river was a lion that morning in strength, voice, and\r\ncolour. Miss Bartlett insisted on leaning over the parapet to look at\r\nit. She then made her usual remark, which was “How I do wish Freddy and\r\nyour mother could see this, too!”\r\n\r\nLucy fidgeted; it was tiresome of Charlotte to have stopped exactly\r\nwhere she did.\r\n\r\n“Look, Lucia! Oh, you are watching for the Torre del Gallo party. I\r\nfeared you would repent you of your choice.”\r\n\r\nSerious as the choice had been, Lucy did not repent. Yesterday had been\r\na muddle—queer and odd, the kind of thing one could not write down\r\neasily on paper—but she had a feeling that Charlotte and her shopping\r\nwere preferable to George Emerson and the summit of the Torre del\r\nGallo. Since she could not unravel the tangle, she must take care not\r\nto re-enter it. She could protest sincerely against Miss Bartlett’s\r\ninsinuations.\r\n\r\nBut though she had avoided the chief actor, the scenery unfortunately\r\nremained. Charlotte, with the complacency of fate, led her from the\r\nriver to the Piazza Signoria. She could not have believed that stones,\r\na Loggia, a fountain, a palace tower, would have such significance. For\r\na moment she understood the nature of ghosts.\r\n\r\nThe exact site of the murder was occupied, not by a ghost, but by Miss\r\nLavish, who had the morning newspaper in her hand. She hailed them\r\nbriskly. The dreadful catastrophe of the previous day had given her an\r\nidea which she thought would work up into a book.\r\n\r\n“Oh, let me congratulate you!” said Miss Bartlett. “After your despair\r\nof yesterday! What a fortunate thing!”\r\n\r\n“Aha! Miss Honeychurch, come you here I am in luck. Now, you are to\r\ntell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning.” Lucy\r\npoked at the ground with her parasol.\r\n\r\n“But perhaps you would rather not?”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry—if you could manage without it, I think I would rather not.”\r\n\r\nThe elder ladies exchanged glances, not of disapproval; it is suitable\r\nthat a girl should feel deeply.\r\n\r\n“It is I who am sorry,” said Miss Lavish. “We literary hacks are\r\nshameless creatures. I believe there’s no secret of the human heart\r\ninto which we wouldn’t pry.”\r\n\r\nShe marched cheerfully to the fountain and back, and did a few\r\ncalculations in realism. Then she said that she had been in the Piazza\r\nsince eight o’clock collecting material. A good deal of it was\r\nunsuitable, but of course one always had to adapt. The two men had\r\nquarrelled over a five-franc note. For the five-franc note she should\r\nsubstitute a young lady, which would raise the tone of the tragedy, and\r\nat the same time furnish an excellent plot.\r\n\r\n“What is the heroine’s name?” asked Miss Bartlett.\r\n\r\n“Leonora,” said Miss Lavish; her own name was Eleanor.\r\n\r\n“I do hope she’s nice.”\r\n\r\nThat desideratum would not be omitted.\r\n\r\n“And what is the plot?”\r\n\r\nLove, murder, abduction, revenge, was the plot. But it all came while\r\nthe fountain plashed to the satyrs in the morning sun.\r\n\r\n“I hope you will excuse me for boring on like this,” Miss Lavish\r\nconcluded. “It is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people. Of\r\ncourse, this is the barest outline. There will be a deal of local\r\ncolouring, descriptions of Florence and the neighbourhood, and I shall\r\nalso introduce some humorous characters. And let me give you all fair\r\nwarning: I intend to be unmerciful to the British tourist.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you wicked woman,” cried Miss Bartlett. “I am sure you are\r\nthinking of the Emersons.”\r\n\r\nMiss Lavish gave a Machiavellian smile.\r\n\r\n“I confess that in Italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen.\r\nIt is the neglected Italians who attract me, and whose lives I am going\r\nto paint so far as I can. For I repeat and I insist, and I have always\r\nheld most strongly, that a tragedy such as yesterday’s is not the less\r\ntragic because it happened in humble life.”\r\n\r\nThere was a fitting silence when Miss Lavish had concluded. Then the\r\ncousins wished success to her labours, and walked slowly away across\r\nthe square.\r\n\r\n“She is my idea of a really clever woman,” said Miss Bartlett. “That\r\nlast remark struck me as so particularly true. It should be a most\r\npathetic novel.”\r\n\r\nLucy assented. At present her great aim was not to get put into it. Her\r\nperceptions this morning were curiously keen, and she believed that\r\nMiss Lavish had her on trial for an _ingenué_.\r\n\r\n“She is emancipated, but only in the very best sense of the word,”\r\ncontinued Miss Bartlett slowly. “None but the superficial would be\r\nshocked at her. We had a long talk yesterday. She believes in justice\r\nand truth and human interest. She told me also that she has a high\r\nopinion of the destiny of woman—Mr. Eager! Why, how nice! What a\r\npleasant surprise!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, not for me,” said the chaplain blandly, “for I have been watching\r\nyou and Miss Honeychurch for quite a little time.”\r\n\r\n“We were chatting to Miss Lavish.”\r\n\r\nHis brow contracted.\r\n\r\n“So I saw. Were you indeed? Andate via! sono occupato!” The last remark\r\nwas made to a vender of panoramic photographs who was approaching with\r\na courteous smile. “I am about to venture a suggestion. Would you and\r\nMiss Honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this week—a\r\ndrive in the hills? We might go up by Fiesole and back by Settignano.\r\nThere is a point on that road where we could get down and have an\r\nhour’s ramble on the hillside. The view thence of Florence is most\r\nbeautiful—far better than the hackneyed view of Fiesole. It is the view\r\nthat Alessio Baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures.\r\nThat man had a decided feeling for landscape. Decidedly. But who looks\r\nat it to-day? Ah, the world is too much for us.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett had not heard of Alessio Baldovinetti, but she knew that\r\nMr. Eager was no commonplace chaplain. He was a member of the\r\nresidential colony who had made Florence their home. He knew the people\r\nwho never walked about with Baedekers, who had learnt to take a siesta\r\nafter lunch, who took drives the pension tourists had never heard of,\r\nand saw by private influence galleries which were closed to them.\r\nLiving in delicate seclusion, some in furnished flats, others in\r\nRenaissance villas on Fiesole’s slope, they read, wrote, studied, and\r\nexchanged ideas, thus attaining to that intimate knowledge, or rather\r\nperception, of Florence which is denied to all who carry in their\r\npockets the coupons of Cook.\r\n\r\nTherefore an invitation from the chaplain was something to be proud of.\r\nBetween the two sections of his flock he was often the only link, and\r\nit was his avowed custom to select those of his migratory sheep who\r\nseemed worthy, and give them a few hours in the pastures of the\r\npermanent. Tea at a Renaissance villa? Nothing had been said about it\r\nyet. But if it did come to that—how Lucy would enjoy it!\r\n\r\nA few days ago and Lucy would have felt the same. But the joys of life\r\nwere grouping themselves anew. A drive in the hills with Mr. Eager and\r\nMiss Bartlett—even if culminating in a residential tea-party—was no\r\nlonger the greatest of them. She echoed the raptures of Charlotte\r\nsomewhat faintly. Only when she heard that Mr. Beebe was also coming\r\ndid her thanks become more sincere.\r\n\r\n“So we shall be a _partie carrée_,” said the chaplain. “In these days\r\nof toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message\r\nof purity. Andate via! andate presto, presto! Ah, the town! Beautiful\r\nas it is, it is the town.”\r\n\r\nThey assented.\r\n\r\n“This very square—so I am told—witnessed yesterday the most sordid of\r\ntragedies. To one who loves the Florence of Dante and Savonarola there\r\nis something portentous in such desecration—portentous and\r\nhumiliating.”\r\n\r\n“Humiliating indeed,” said Miss Bartlett. “Miss Honeychurch happened to\r\nbe passing through as it happened. She can hardly bear to speak of it.”\r\nShe glanced at Lucy proudly.\r\n\r\n“And how came we to have you here?” asked the chaplain paternally.\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett’s recent liberalism oozed away at the question. “Do not\r\nblame her, please, Mr. Eager. The fault is mine: I left her\r\nunchaperoned.”\r\n\r\n“So you were here alone, Miss Honeychurch?” His voice suggested\r\nsympathetic reproof but at the same time indicated that a few harrowing\r\ndetails would not be unacceptable. His dark, handsome face drooped\r\nmournfully towards her to catch her reply.\r\n\r\n“Practically.”\r\n\r\n“One of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home,” said Miss\r\nBartlett, adroitly concealing the sex of the preserver.\r\n\r\n“For her also it must have been a terrible experience. I trust that\r\nneither of you was at all—that it was not in your immediate proximity?”\r\n\r\nOf the many things Lucy was noticing to-day, not the least remarkable\r\nwas this: the ghoulish fashion in which respectable people will nibble\r\nafter blood. George Emerson had kept the subject strangely pure.\r\n\r\n“He died by the fountain, I believe,” was her reply.\r\n\r\n“And you and your friend—”\r\n\r\n“Were over at the Loggia.”\r\n\r\n“That must have saved you much. You have not, of course, seen the\r\ndisgraceful illustrations which the gutter Press—This man is a public\r\nnuisance; he knows that I am a resident perfectly well, and yet he goes\r\non worrying me to buy his vulgar views.”\r\n\r\nSurely the vendor of photographs was in league with Lucy—in the eternal\r\nleague of Italy with youth. He had suddenly extended his book before\r\nMiss Bartlett and Mr. Eager, binding their hands together by a long\r\nglossy ribbon of churches, pictures, and views.\r\n\r\n“This is too much!” cried the chaplain, striking petulantly at one of\r\nFra Angelico’s angels. She tore. A shrill cry rose from the vendor. The\r\nbook it seemed, was more valuable than one would have supposed.\r\n\r\n“Willingly would I purchase—” began Miss Bartlett.\r\n\r\n“Ignore him,” said Mr. Eager sharply, and they all walked rapidly away\r\nfrom the square.\r\n\r\nBut an Italian can never be ignored, least of all when he has a\r\ngrievance. His mysterious persecution of Mr. Eager became relentless;\r\nthe air rang with his threats and lamentations. He appealed to Lucy;\r\nwould not she intercede? He was poor—he sheltered a family—the tax on\r\nbread. He waited, he gibbered, he was recompensed, he was dissatisfied,\r\nhe did not leave them until he had swept their minds clean of all\r\nthoughts whether pleasant or unpleasant.\r\n\r\nShopping was the topic that now ensued. Under the chaplain’s guidance\r\nthey selected many hideous presents and mementoes—florid little\r\npicture-frames that seemed fashioned in gilded pastry; other little\r\nframes, more severe, that stood on little easels, and were carven out\r\nof oak; a blotting book of vellum; a Dante of the same material; cheap\r\nmosaic brooches, which the maids, next Christmas, would never tell from\r\nreal; pins, pots, heraldic saucers, brown art-photographs; Eros and\r\nPsyche in alabaster; St. Peter to match—all of which would have cost\r\nless in London.\r\n\r\nThis successful morning left no pleasant impressions on Lucy. She had\r\nbeen a little frightened, both by Miss Lavish and by Mr. Eager, she\r\nknew not why. And as they frightened her, she had, strangely enough,\r\nceased to respect them. She doubted that Miss Lavish was a great\r\nartist. She doubted that Mr. Eager was as full of spirituality and\r\nculture as she had been led to suppose. They were tried by some new\r\ntest, and they were found wanting. As for Charlotte—as for Charlotte\r\nshe was exactly the same. It might be possible to be nice to her; it\r\nwas impossible to love her.\r\n\r\n“The son of a labourer; I happen to know it for a fact. A mechanic of\r\nsome sort himself when he was young; then he took to writing for the\r\nSocialistic Press. I came across him at Brixton.”\r\n\r\nThey were talking about the Emersons.\r\n\r\n“How wonderfully people rise in these days!” sighed Miss Bartlett,\r\nfingering a model of the leaning Tower of Pisa.\r\n\r\n“Generally,” replied Mr. Eager, “one has only sympathy for their\r\nsuccess. The desire for education and for social advance—in these\r\nthings there is something not wholly vile. There are some working men\r\nwhom one would be very willing to see out here in Florence—little as\r\nthey would make of it.”\r\n\r\n“Is he a journalist now?” Miss Bartlett asked.\r\n\r\n“He is not; he made an advantageous marriage.”\r\n\r\nHe uttered this remark with a voice full of meaning, and ended with a\r\nsigh.\r\n\r\n“Oh, so he has a wife.”\r\n\r\n“Dead, Miss Bartlett, dead. I wonder—yes I wonder how he has the\r\neffrontery to look me in the face, to dare to claim acquaintance with\r\nme. He was in my London parish long ago. The other day in Santa Croce,\r\nwhen he was with Miss Honeychurch, I snubbed him. Let him beware that\r\nhe does not get more than a snub.”\r\n\r\n“What?” cried Lucy, flushing.\r\n\r\n“Exposure!” hissed Mr. Eager.\r\n\r\nHe tried to change the subject; but in scoring a dramatic point he had\r\ninterested his audience more than he had intended. Miss Bartlett was\r\nfull of very natural curiosity. Lucy, though she wished never to see\r\nthe Emersons again, was not disposed to condemn them on a single word.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean,” she asked, “that he is an irreligious man? We know that\r\nalready.”\r\n\r\n“Lucy, dear—” said Miss Bartlett, gently reproving her cousin’s\r\npenetration.\r\n\r\n“I should be astonished if you knew all. The boy—an innocent child at\r\nthe time—I will exclude. God knows what his education and his inherited\r\nqualities may have made him.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” said Miss Bartlett, “it is something that we had better not\r\nhear.”\r\n\r\n“To speak plainly,” said Mr. Eager, “it is. I will say no more.” For\r\nthe first time Lucy’s rebellious thoughts swept out in words—for the\r\nfirst time in her life.\r\n\r\n“You have said very little.”\r\n\r\n“It was my intention to say very little,” was his frigid reply.\r\n\r\nHe gazed indignantly at the girl, who met him with equal indignation.\r\nShe turned towards him from the shop counter; her breast heaved\r\nquickly. He observed her brow, and the sudden strength of her lips. It\r\nwas intolerable that she should disbelieve him.\r\n\r\n“Murder, if you want to know,” he cried angrily. “That man murdered his\r\nwife!”\r\n\r\n“How?” she retorted.\r\n\r\n“To all intents and purposes he murdered her. That day in Santa\r\nCroce—did they say anything against me?”\r\n\r\n“Not a word, Mr. Eager—not a single word.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I thought they had been libelling me to you. But I suppose it is\r\nonly their personal charms that makes you defend them.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not defending them,” said Lucy, losing her courage, and relapsing\r\ninto the old chaotic methods. “The"

Out they toddled from rugged\r\nAvila, wide-eyed and helpless-looking as two fawns, but with human\r\nhearts, already beating to a national idea; until domestic reality met\r\nthem in the shape of uncles, and turned them back from their great\r\nresolve. That child-pilgrimage was a fit beginning. Theresa’s\r\npassionate, ideal nature demanded an epic life: what were many-volumed\r\nromances of chivalry and the social conquests of a brilliant girl to\r\nher? Her flame quickly burned up that light fuel; and, fed from within,\r\nsoared after some illimitable satisfaction, some object which would\r\nnever justify weariness, which would reconcile self-despair with the\r\nrapturous consciousness of life beyond self. She found her epos in the\r\nreform of a religious order.\r\n\r\nThat Spanish woman who lived three hundred years ago, was certainly not\r\nthe last of her kind. Many Theresas have been born who found for\r\nthemselves no epic life wherein there was a constant unfolding of\r\nfar-resonant action; perhaps only a life of mistakes, the offspring of\r\na certain spiritual grandeur ill-matched with the meanness of\r\nopportunity; perhaps a tragic failure which found no sacred poet and\r\nsank unwept into oblivion. With dim lights and tangled circumstance\r\nthey tried to shape their thought and deed in noble agreement; but\r\nafter all, to common eyes their struggles seemed mere inconsistency and\r\nformlessness; for these later-born Theresas were helped by no coherent\r\nsocial faith and order which could perform the function of knowledge\r\nfor the ardently willing soul. Their ardor alternated between a vague\r\nideal and the common yearning of womanhood; so that the one was\r\ndisapproved as extravagance, and the other condemned as a lapse.\r\n\r\nSome have felt that these blundering lives are due to the inconvenient\r\nindefiniteness with which the Supreme Power has fashioned the natures\r\nof women: if there were one level of feminine incompetence as strict as\r\nthe ability to count three and no more, the social lot of women might\r\nbe treated with scientific certitude. Meanwhile the indefiniteness\r\nremains, and the limits of variation are really much wider than any one\r\nwould imagine from the sameness of women’s coiffure and the favorite\r\nlove-stories in prose and verse. Here and there a cygnet is reared\r\nuneasily among the ducklings in the brown pond, and never finds the\r\nliving stream in fellowship with its own oary-footed kind. Here and\r\nthere is born a Saint Theresa, foundress of nothing, whose loving\r\nheart-beats and sobs after an unattained goodness tremble off and are\r\ndispersed among hindrances, instead of centring in some\r\nlong-recognizable deed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\nMISS BROOKE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nSince I can do no good because a woman,\r\nReach constantly at something that is near it.\r\n                    —_The Maid’s Tragedy:_ BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Brooke had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown into\r\nrelief by poor dress. Her hand and wrist were so finely formed that she\r\ncould wear sleeves not less bare of style than those in which the\r\nBlessed Virgin appeared to Italian painters; and her profile as well as\r\nher stature and bearing seemed to gain the more dignity from her plain\r\ngarments, which by the side of provincial fashion gave her the\r\nimpressiveness of a fine quotation from the Bible,—or from one of our\r\nelder poets,—in a paragraph of to-day’s newspaper. She was usually\r\nspoken of as being remarkably clever, but with the addition that her\r\nsister Celia had more common-sense. Nevertheless, Celia wore scarcely\r\nmore trimmings; and it was only to close observers that her dress\r\ndiffered from her sister’s, and had a shade of coquetry in its\r\narrangements; for Miss Brooke’s plain dressing was due to mixed\r\nconditions, in most of which her sister shared. The pride of being\r\nladies had something to do with it: the Brooke connections, though not\r\nexactly aristocratic, were unquestionably “good:” if you inquired\r\nbackward for a generation or two, you would not find any yard-measuring\r\nor parcel-tying forefathers—anything lower than an admiral or a\r\nclergyman; and there was even an ancestor discernible as a Puritan\r\ngentleman who served under Cromwell, but afterwards conformed, and\r\nmanaged to come out of all political troubles as the proprietor of a\r\nrespectable family estate. Young women of such birth, living in a quiet\r\ncountry-house, and attending a village church hardly larger than a\r\nparlor, naturally regarded frippery as the ambition of a huckster’s\r\ndaughter. Then there was well-bred economy, which in those days made\r\nshow in dress the first item to be deducted from, when any margin was\r\nrequired for expenses more distinctive of rank. Such reasons would have\r\nbeen enough to account for plain dress, quite apart from religious\r\nfeeling; but in Miss Brooke’s case, religion alone would have\r\ndetermined it; and Celia mildly acquiesced in all her sister’s\r\nsentiments, only infusing them with that common-sense which is able to\r\naccept momentous doctrines without any eccentric agitation. Dorothea\r\nknew many passages of Pascal’s Pensees and of Jeremy Taylor by heart;\r\nand to her the destinies of mankind, seen by the light of Christianity,\r\nmade the solicitudes of feminine fashion appear an occupation for\r\nBedlam. She could not reconcile the anxieties of a spiritual life\r\ninvolving eternal consequences, with a keen interest in gimp and\r\nartificial protrusions of drapery. Her mind was theoretic, and yearned\r\nby its nature after some lofty conception of the world which might\r\nfrankly include the parish of Tipton and her own rule of conduct there;\r\nshe was enamoured of intensity and greatness, and rash in embracing\r\nwhatever seemed to her to have those aspects; likely to seek martyrdom,\r\nto make retractations, and then to incur martyrdom after all in a\r\nquarter where she had not sought it. Certainly such elements in the\r\ncharacter of a marriageable girl tended to interfere with her lot, and\r\nhinder it from being decided according to custom, by good looks,\r\nvanity, and merely canine affection. With all this, she, the elder of\r\nthe sisters, was not yet twenty, and they had both been educated, since\r\nthey were about twelve years old and had lost their parents, on plans\r\nat once narrow and promiscuous, first in an English family and\r\nafterwards in a Swiss family at Lausanne, their bachelor uncle and\r\nguardian trying in this way to remedy the disadvantages of their\r\norphaned condition.\r\n\r\nIt was hardly a year since they had come to live at Tipton Grange with\r\ntheir uncle, a man nearly sixty, of acquiescent temper, miscellaneous\r\nopinions, and uncertain vote. He had travelled in his younger years,\r\nand was held in this part of the county to have contracted a too\r\nrambling habit of mind. Mr. Brooke’s conclusions were as difficult to\r\npredict as the weather: it was only safe to say that he would act with\r\nbenevolent intentions, and that he would spend as little money as\r\npossible in carrying them out. For the most glutinously indefinite\r\nminds enclose some hard grains of habit; and a man has been seen lax\r\nabout all his own interests except the retention of his snuff-box,\r\nconcerning which he was watchful, suspicious, and greedy of clutch.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Brooke the hereditary strain of Puritan energy was clearly in\r\nabeyance; but in his niece Dorothea it glowed alike through faults and\r\nvirtues, turning sometimes into impatience of her uncle’s talk or his\r\nway of “letting things be” on his estate, and making her long all the\r\nmore for the time when she would be of age and have some command of\r\nmoney for generous schemes. She was regarded as an heiress; for not\r\nonly had the sisters seven hundred a-year each from their parents, but\r\nif Dorothea married and had a son, that son would inherit Mr. Brooke’s\r\nestate, presumably worth about three thousand a-year—a rental which\r\nseemed wealth to provincial families, still discussing Mr. Peel’s late\r\nconduct on the Catholic question, innocent of future gold-fields, and\r\nof that gorgeous plutocracy which has so nobly exalted the necessities\r\nof genteel life.\r\n\r\nAnd how should Dorothea not marry?—a girl so handsome and with such\r\nprospects? Nothing could hinder it but her love of extremes, and her\r\ninsistence on regulating life according to notions which might cause a\r\nwary man to hesitate before he made her an offer, or even might lead\r\nher at last to refuse all offers. A young lady of some birth and\r\nfortune, who knelt suddenly down on a brick floor by the side of a sick\r\nlaborer and prayed fervidly as if she thought herself living in the\r\ntime of the Apostles—who had strange whims of fasting like a Papist,\r\nand of sitting up at night to read old theological books! Such a wife\r\nmight awaken you some fine morning with a new scheme for the\r\napplication of her income which would interfere with political economy\r\nand the keeping of saddle-horses: a man would naturally think twice\r\nbefore he risked himself in such fellowship. Women were expected to\r\nhave weak opinions; but the great safeguard of society and of domestic\r\nlife was, that opinions were not acted on. Sane people did what their\r\nneighbors did, so that if any lunatics were at large, one might know\r\nand avoid them.\r\n\r\nThe rural opinion about the new young ladies, even among the cottagers,\r\nwas generally in favor of Celia, as being so amiable and\r\ninnocent-looking, while Miss Brooke’s large eyes seemed, like her\r\nreligion, too unusual and striking. Poor Dorothea! compared with her,\r\nthe innocent-looking Celia was knowing and worldly-wise; so much\r\nsubtler is a human mind than the outside tissues which make a sort of\r\nblazonry or clock-face for it.\r\n\r\nYet those who approached Dorothea, though prejudiced against her by\r\nthis alarming hearsay, found that she had a charm unaccountably\r\nreconcilable with it. Most men thought her bewitching when she was on\r\nhorseback. She loved the fresh air and the various aspects of the\r\ncountry, and when her eyes and cheeks glowed with mingled pleasure she\r\nlooked very little like a devotee. Riding was an indulgence which she\r\nallowed herself in spite of conscientious qualms; she felt that she\r\nenjoyed it in a pagan sensuous way, and always looked forward to\r\nrenouncing it.\r\n\r\nShe was open, ardent, and not in the least self-admiring; indeed, it\r\nwas pretty to see how her imagination adorned her sister Celia with\r\nattractions altogether superior to her own, and if any gentleman\r\nappeared to come to the Grange from some other motive than that of\r\nseeing Mr. Brooke, she concluded that he must be in love with Celia:\r\nSir James Chettam, for example, whom she constantly considered from\r\nCelia’s point of view, inwardly debating whether it would be good for\r\nCelia to accept him. That he should be regarded as a suitor to herself\r\nwould have seemed to her a ridiculous irrelevance. Dorothea, with all\r\nher eagerness to know the truths of life, retained very childlike ideas\r\nabout marriage. She felt sure that she would have accepted the\r\njudicious Hooker, if she had been born in time to save him from that\r\nwretched mistake he made in matrimony; or John Milton when his\r\nblindness had come on; or any of the other great men whose odd habits\r\nit would have been glorious piety to endure; but an amiable handsome\r\nbaronet, who said “Exactly” to her remarks even when she expressed\r\nuncertainty,—how could he affect her as a lover? The really delightful\r\nmarriage must be that where your husband was a sort of father, and\r\ncould teach you even Hebrew, if you wished it.\r\n\r\nThese peculiarities of Dorothea’s character caused Mr. Brooke to be all\r\nthe more blamed in neighboring families for not securing some\r\nmiddle-aged lady as guide and companion to his nieces. But he himself\r\ndreaded so much the sort of superior woman likely to be available for\r\nsuch a position, that he allowed himself to be dissuaded by Dorothea’s\r\nobjections, and was in this case brave enough to defy the world—that is\r\nto say, Mrs. Cadwallader the Rector’s wife, and the small group of\r\ngentry with whom he visited in the northeast corner of Loamshire. So\r\nMiss Brooke presided in her uncle’s household, and did not at all\r\ndislike her new authority, with the homage that belonged to it.\r\n\r\nSir James Chettam was going to dine at the Grange to-day with another\r\ngentleman whom the girls had never seen, and about whom Dorothea felt\r\nsome venerating expectation. This was the Reverend Edward Casaubon,\r\nnoted in the county as a man of profound learning, understood for many\r\nyears to be engaged on a great work concerning religious history; also\r\nas a man of wealth enough to give lustre to his piety, and having views\r\nof his own which were to be more clearly ascertained on the publication\r\nof his book. His very name carried an impressiveness hardly to be\r\nmeasured without a precise chronology of scholarship.\r\n\r\nEarly in the day Dorothea had returned from the infant school which she\r\nhad set going in the village, and was taking her usual place in the\r\npretty sitting-room which divided the bedrooms of the sisters, bent on\r\nfinishing a plan for some buildings (a kind of work which she delighted\r\nin), when Celia, who had been watching her with a hesitating desire to\r\npropose something, said—\r\n\r\n“Dorothea, dear, if you don’t mind—if you are not very busy—suppose we\r\nlooked at mamma’s jewels to-day, and divided them? It is exactly six\r\nmonths to-day since uncle gave them to you, and you have not looked at\r\nthem yet.”\r\n\r\nCelia’s face had the shadow of a pouting expression in it, the full\r\npresence of the pout being kept back by an habitual awe of Dorothea and\r\nprinciple; two associated facts which might show a mysterious\r\nelectricity if you touched them incautiously. To her relief, Dorothea’s\r\neyes were full of laughter as she looked up.\r\n\r\n“What a wonderful little almanac you are, Celia! Is it six calendar or\r\nsix lunar months?”\r\n\r\n“It is the last day of September now, and it was the first of April\r\nwhen uncle gave them to you. You know, he said that he had forgotten\r\nthem till then. I believe you have never thought of them since you\r\nlocked them up in the cabinet here.”\r\n\r\n“Well, dear, we should never wear them, you know.” Dorothea spoke in a\r\nfull cordial tone, half caressing, half explanatory. She had her pencil\r\nin her hand, and was making tiny side-plans on a margin.\r\n\r\nCelia colored, and looked very grave. “I think, dear, we are wanting in\r\nrespect to mamma’s memory, to put them by and take no notice of them.\r\nAnd,” she added, after hesitating a little, with a rising sob of\r\nmortification, “necklaces are quite usual now; and Madame Poincon, who\r\nwas stricter in some things even than you are, used to wear ornaments.\r\nAnd Christians generally—surely there are women in heaven now who wore\r\njewels.” Celia was conscious of some mental strength when she really\r\napplied herself to argument.\r\n\r\n“You would like to wear them?” exclaimed Dorothea, an air of astonished\r\ndiscovery animating her whole person with a dramatic action which she\r\nhad caught from that very Madame Poincon who wore the ornaments. “Of\r\ncourse, then, let us have them out. Why did you not tell me before? But\r\nthe keys, the keys!” She pressed her hands against the sides of her\r\nhead and seemed to despair of her memory.\r\n\r\n“They are here,” said Celia, with whom this explanation had been long\r\nmeditated and prearranged.\r\n\r\n“Pray open the large drawer of the cabinet and get out the jewel-box.”\r\n\r\nThe casket was soon open before them, and the various jewels spread\r\nout, making a bright parterre on the table. It was no great collection,\r\nbut a few of the ornaments were really of remarkable beauty, the finest\r\nthat was obvious at first being a necklace of purple amethysts set in\r\nexquisite gold work, and a pearl cross with five brilliants in it.\r\nDorothea immediately took up the necklace and fastened it round her\r\nsister’s neck, where it fitted almost as closely as a bracelet; but the\r\ncircle suited the Henrietta-Maria style of Celia’s head and neck, and\r\nshe could see that it did, in the pier-glass opposite.\r\n\r\n“There, Celia! you can wear that with your Indian muslin. But this\r\ncross you must wear with your dark dresses.”\r\n\r\nCelia was trying not to smile with pleasure. “O Dodo, you must keep the\r\ncross yourself.”\r\n\r\n“No, no, dear, no,” said Dorothea, putting up her hand with careless\r\ndeprecation.\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed you must; it would suit you—in your black dress, now,”\r\nsaid Celia, insistingly. “You _might_ wear that.”\r\n\r\n“Not for the world, not for the world. A cross is the last thing I\r\nwould wear as a trinket.” Dorothea shuddered slightly.\r\n\r\n“Then you will think it wicked in me to wear it,” said Celia, uneasily.\r\n\r\n“No, dear, no,” said Dorothea, stroking her sister’s cheek. “Souls have\r\ncomplexions too: what will suit one will not suit another.”\r\n\r\n“But you might like to keep it for mamma’s sake.”\r\n\r\n“No, I have other things of mamma’s—her sandal-wood box which I am so\r\nfond of—plenty of things. In fact, they are all yours, dear. We need\r\ndiscuss them no longer. There—take away your property.”\r\n\r\nCelia felt a little hurt. There was a strong assumption of superiority\r\nin this Puritanic toleration, hardly less trying to the blond flesh of\r\nan unenthusiastic sister than a Puritanic persecution.\r\n\r\n“But how can I wear ornaments if you, who are the elder sister, will\r\nnever wear them?”\r\n\r\n“Nay, Celia, that is too much to ask, that I should wear trinkets to\r\nkeep you in countenance. If I were to put on such a necklace as that, I\r\nshould feel as if I had been pirouetting. The world would go round with\r\nme, and I should not know how to walk.”\r\n\r\nCelia had unclasped the necklace and drawn it off. “It would be a\r\nlittle tight for your neck; something to lie down and hang would suit\r\nyou better,” she said, with some satisfaction. The complete unfitness\r\nof the necklace from all points of view for Dorothea, made Celia\r\nhappier in taking it. She was opening some ring-boxes, which disclosed\r\na fine emerald with diamonds, and just then the sun passing beyond a\r\ncloud sent a bright gleam over the table.\r\n\r\n“How very beautiful these gems are!” said Dorothea, under a new current\r\nof feeling, as sudden as the gleam. “It is strange how deeply colors\r\nseem to penetrate one, like scent. I suppose that is the reason why\r\ngems are used as spiritual emblems in the Revelation of St. John. They\r\nlook like fragments of heaven. I think that emerald is more beautiful\r\nthan any of them.”\r\n\r\n“And there is a bracelet to match it,” said Celia. “We did not notice\r\nthis at first.”\r\n\r\n“They are lovely,” said Dorothea, slipping the ring and bracelet on her\r\nfinely turned finger and wrist, and holding them towards the window on\r\na level with her eyes. All the while her thought was trying to justify\r\nher delight in the colors by merging them in her mystic religious joy.\r\n\r\n“You _would_ like those, Dorothea,” said Celia, rather falteringly,\r\nbeginning to think with wonder that her sister showed some weakness,\r\nand also that emeralds would suit her own complexion even better than\r\npurple amethysts. “You must keep that ring and bracelet—if nothing\r\nelse. But see, these agates are very pretty and quiet.”\r\n\r\n“Yes! I will keep these—this ring and bracelet,” said Dorothea. Then,\r\nletting her hand fall on the table, she said in another tone—“Yet what\r\nmiserable men find such things, and work at them, and sell them!” She\r\npaused again, and Celia thought that her sister was going to renounce\r\nthe ornaments, as in consistency she ought to do.\r\n\r\n“Yes, dear, I will keep these,” said Dorothea, decidedly. “But take all\r\nthe rest away, and the casket.”\r\n\r\nShe took up her pencil without removing the jewels, and still looking\r\nat them. She thought of often having them by her, to feed her eye at\r\nthese little fountains of pure color.\r\n\r\n“Shall you wear them in company?” said Celia, who was watching her with\r\nreal curiosity as to what she would do.\r\n\r\nDorothea glanced quickly at her sister. Across all her imaginative\r\nadornment of those whom she loved, there darted now and then a keen\r\ndiscernment, which was not without a scorching quality. If Miss Brooke\r\never attained perfect meekness, it would not be for lack of inward\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” she said, rather haughtily. “I cannot tell to what level I\r\nmay sink.”\r\n\r\nCelia blushed, and was unhappy: she saw that she had offended her\r\nsister, and dared not say even anything pretty about the gift of the\r\nornaments which she put back into the box and carried away. Dorothea\r\ntoo was unhappy, as she went on with her plan-drawing, questioning the\r\npurity of her own feeling and speech in the scene which had ended with\r\nthat little explosion.\r\n\r\nCelia’s consciousness told her that she had not been at all in the\r\nwrong: it was quite natural and justifiable that she should have asked\r\nthat question, and she repeated to herself that Dorothea was\r\ninconsistent: either she should have taken her full share of the\r\njewels, or, after what she had said, she should have renounced them\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n“I am sure—at least, I trust,” thought Celia, “that the wearing of a\r\nnecklace will not interfere with my prayers. And I do not see that I\r\nshould be bound by Dorothea’s opinions now we are going into society,\r\nthough of course she herself ought to be bound by them. But Dorothea is\r\nnot always consistent.”\r\n\r\nThus Celia, mutely bending over her tapestry, until she heard her\r\nsister calling her.\r\n\r\n“Here, Kitty, come and look at my plan; I shall think I am a great\r\narchitect, if I have not got incompatible stairs and fireplaces.”\r\n\r\nAs Celia bent over the paper, Dorothea put her cheek against her\r\nsister’s arm caressingly. Celia understood the action. Dorothea saw\r\nthat she had been in the wrong, and Celia pardoned her. Since they\r\ncould remember, there had been a mixture of criticism and awe in the\r\nattitude of Celia’s mind towards her elder sister. The younger had\r\nalways worn a yoke; but is there any yoked creature without its private\r\nopinions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n“‘Dime; no ves aquel caballero que hacia nosotros viene sobre un\r\ncaballo rucio rodado que trae puesto en la cabeza un yelmo de oro?’ ‘Lo\r\nque veo y columbro,’ respondio Sancho, ‘no es sino un hombre sobre un\r\nas no pardo como el mio, que trae sobre la cabeza una cosa que\r\nrelumbra.’ ‘Pues ese es el yelmo de Mambrino,’ dijo Don\r\nQuijote.”—CERVANTES.\r\n\r\n\r\n“‘Seest thou not yon cavalier who cometh toward us on a dapple-gray\r\nsteed, and weareth a golden helmet?’ ‘What I see,’ answered Sancho, ‘is\r\nnothing but a man on a gray ass like my own, who carries something\r\nshiny on his head.’ ‘Just so,’ answered Don Quixote: ‘and that\r\nresplendent object is the helmet of Mambrino.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sir Humphry Davy?” said Mr. Brooke, over the soup, in his easy smiling\r\nway, taking up Sir James Chettam’s remark that he was studying Davy’s\r\nAgricultural Chemistry. “Well, now, Sir Humphry Davy; I dined with him\r\nyears ago at Cartwright’s, and Wordsworth was there too—the poet\r\nWordsworth, you know. Now there was something singular. I was at\r\nCambridge when Wordsworth was there, and I never met him—and I dined\r\nwith him twenty years afterwards at Cartwright’s. There’s an oddity in\r\nthings, now. But Davy was there: he was a poet too. Or, as I may say,\r\nWordsworth was poet one, and Davy was poet two. That was true in every\r\nsense, you know.”\r\n\r\nDorothea felt a little more uneasy than usual. In the beginning of\r\ndinner, the party being small and the room still, these motes from the\r\nmass of a magistrate’s mind fell too noticeably. She wondered how a man\r\nlike Mr. Casaubon would support such triviality. His manners, she\r\nthought, were very dignified; the set of his iron-gray hair and his\r\ndeep eye-sockets made him resemble the portrait of Locke. He had the\r\nspare form and the pale complexion which became a student; as different\r\nas possible from the blooming Englishman of the red-whiskered type\r\nrepresented by Sir James Chettam.\r\n\r\n“I am reading the Agricultural Chemistry,” said this excellent baronet,\r\n“because I am going to take one of the farms into my own hands, and see\r\nif something cannot be done in setting a good pattern of farming among\r\nmy tenants. Do you approve of that, Miss Brooke?”\r\n\r\n“A great mistake, Chettam,” interposed Mr. Brooke, “going into\r\nelectrifying your land and that kind of thing, and making a parlor of\r\nyour cow-house. It won’t do. I went into science a great deal myself at\r\none time; but I saw it would not do. It leads to everything; you can\r\nlet nothing alone. No, no—see that your tenants don’t sell their straw,\r\nand that kind of thing; and give them draining-tiles, you know. But\r\nyour fancy farming will not do—the most expensive sort of whistle you\r\ncan buy: you may as well keep a pack of hounds.”\r\n\r\n“Surely,” said Dorothea, “it is better to spend money in finding out\r\nhow men can make the most of the land which supports them all, than in\r\nkeeping dogs and horses only to gallop over it. It is not a sin to make\r\nyourself poor in performing experiments for the good of all.”\r\n\r\nShe spoke with more energy than is expected of so young a lady, but Sir\r\nJames had appealed to her. He was accustomed to do so, and she had\r\noften thought that she could urge him to many good actions when he was\r\nher brother-in-law.\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon turned his eyes very markedly on Dorothea while she was\r\nspeaking, and seemed to observe her newly.\r\n\r\n“Young ladies don’t understand political economy, you know,” said Mr.\r\nBrooke, smiling towards Mr. Casaubon. “I remember when we were all\r\nreading Adam Smith. _There_ is a book, now. I took in all the new ideas\r\nat one time—human perfectibility, now. But some say, history moves in\r\ncircles; and that may be very well argued; I have argued it myself. The\r\nfact is, human reason may carry you a little too far—over the hedge, in\r\nfact. It carried me a good way at one time; but I saw it would not do.\r\nI pulled up; I pulled up in time. But not too hard. I have always been\r\nin favor of a little theory: we must have Thought; else we shall be\r\nlanded back in the dark ages. But talking of books, there is Southey’s\r\n‘Peninsular War.’ I am reading that of a morning. You know Southey?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Mr. Casaubon, not keeping pace with Mr. Brooke’s impetuous\r\nreason, and thinking of the book only. “I have little leisure for such\r\nliterature just now. I have been using up my eyesight on old characters\r\nlately; the fact is, I want a reader for my evenings; but I am\r\nfastidious in voices, and I cannot endure listening to an imperfect\r\nreader. It is a misfortune, in some senses: I feed too much on the\r\ninward sources; I live too much with the dead. My mind is something\r\nlike the ghost of an ancient, wandering about the world and trying\r\nmentally to construct it as it used to be, in spite of ruin and\r\nconfusing changes. But I find it necessary to use the utmost caution\r\nabout my eyesight.”\r\n\r\nThis was the first time that Mr. Casaubon had spoken at any length. He\r\ndelivered himself with precision, as if he had been called upon to make\r\na public statement; and the balanced sing-song neatness of his speech,\r\noccasionally corresponded to by a movement of his head, was the more\r\nconspicuous from its contrast with good Mr. Brooke’s scrappy\r\nslovenliness. Dorothea said to herself that Mr. Casaubon was the most\r\ninteresting man she had ever seen, not excepting even Monsieur Liret,\r\nthe Vaudois clergyman who had given conferences on the history of the\r\nWaldenses. To reconstruct a past world, doubtless with a view to the\r\nhighest purposes of truth—what a work to be in any way present at, to\r\nassist in, though only as a lamp-holder! This elevating thought lifted\r\nher above her annoyance at being twitted with her ignorance of\r\npolitical economy, that never-explained science which was thrust as an\r\nextinguisher over all her lights.\r\n\r\n“But you are fond of riding, Miss Brooke,” Sir James presently took an\r\nopportunity of saying. “I should have thought you would enter a little\r\ninto the pleasures of hunting. I wish you would let me send over a\r\nchestnut horse for you to try. It has been trained for a lady. I saw\r\nyou on Saturday cantering over the hill on a nag not worthy of you. My\r\ngroom shall bring Corydon for you every day, if you will only mention\r\nthe time.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, you are very good. I mean to give up riding. I shall not\r\nride any more,” said Dorothea, urged to this brusque resolution by a\r\nlittle annoyance that Sir James would be soliciting her attention when\r\nshe wanted to give it all to Mr. Casaubon.\r\n\r\n“No, that is too hard,” said Sir James, in a tone of reproach that\r\nshowed strong interest. “Your sister is given to self-mortification, is\r\nshe not?” he continued, turning to Celia, who sat at his right hand.\r\n\r\n“I think she is,” said Celia, feeling afraid lest she should say\r\nsomething that would not please her sister, and blushing as prettily as\r\npossible above her necklace. “She likes giving up.”\r\n\r\n“If that were true, Celia, my giving-up would be self-indulgence, not\r\nself-mortification. But there may be good reasons for choosing not to\r\ndo what is very agreeable,” said Dorothea.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke was speaking at the same time, but it was evident that Mr.\r\nCasaubon was observing Dorothea, and she was aware of it.\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said Sir James. “You give up from some high, generous\r\nmotive.”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed, not exactly. I did not say that of myself,” answered\r\nDorothea, reddening. Unlike Celia, she rarely blushed, and only from\r\nhigh delight or anger. At this moment she felt angry with the perverse\r\nSir James. Why did he not pay attention to Celia, and leave her to\r\nlisten to Mr. Casaubon?—if that learned man would only talk, instead of\r\nallowing himself to be talked to by Mr. Brooke, who was just then\r\ninforming him that the Reformation either meant something or it did\r\nnot, that he himself was a Protestant to the core, but that Catholicism\r\nwas a fact; and as to refusing an acre of your ground for a Romanist\r\nchapel, all men needed the bridle of religion, which, properly\r\nspeaking, was the dread of a Hereafter.\r\n\r\n“I made a great study of theology at one time,” said Mr. Brooke, as if\r\nto explain the insight just manifested. “I know something of all\r\nschools. I knew Wilberforce in his best days. Do you know Wilberforce?”\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon said, “No.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Wilberforce was perhaps not enough of a thinker; but if I went\r\ninto Parliament, as I have been asked to do, I should sit on the\r\nindependent bench, as Wilberforce did, and work at philanthropy.”\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon bowed, and observed that it was a wide field.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mr. Brooke, with an easy smile, “but I have documents. I\r\nbegan a long while ago to collect documents. They want arranging, but\r\nwhen a question has struck me, I have written to somebody and got an\r\nanswer. I have documents at my back. But now, how do you arrange your\r\ndocuments?”\r\n\r\n“In pigeon-holes partly,” said Mr. Casaubon, with rather a startled air\r\nof effort.\r\n\r\n“Ah, pigeon-holes will not do. I have tried pigeon-holes, but\r\neverything gets mixed in pigeon-holes: I never know whether a paper is\r\nin A or Z.”\r\n\r\n“I wish you would let me sort your papers for you, uncle,” said\r\nDorothea. “I would letter them all, and then make a list of subjects\r\nunder each letter.”\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon gravely smiled approval, and said to Mr. Brooke, “You have\r\nan excellent secretary at hand, you perceive.”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” said Mr. Brooke, shaking his head; “I cannot let young ladies\r\nmeddle with my documents. Young ladies are too flighty.”\r\n\r\nDorothea felt hurt. Mr. Casaubon would think that her uncle had some\r\nspecial reason for delivering this opinion, whereas the remark lay in\r\nhis mind as lightly as the broken wing of an insect among all the other\r\nfragments there, and a chance current had sent it alighting on _her_.\r\n\r\nWhen the two girls were in the drawing-room alone, Celia said—\r\n\r\n“How very ugly Mr. Casaubon is!”\r\n\r\n“Celia! He is one of the most distinguished-looking men I ever saw. He\r\nis remarkably like the portrait of Locke. He has the same deep\r\neye-sockets.”\r\n\r\n“Had Locke those two white moles with hairs on them?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I dare say! when people of a certain sort looked at him,” said\r\nDorothea, walking away a little.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Casaubon is so sallow.”\r\n\r\n“All the better. I suppose you admire a man with the complexion of a\r\n_cochon de lait_.”\r\n\r\n“Dodo!” exclaimed Celia, looking after her in surprise. “I never heard\r\nyou make such a comparison before.”\r\n\r\n“Why should I make it before the occasion came? It is a good\r\ncomparison: the match is perfect.”\r\n\r\nMiss Brooke was clearly forgetting herself, and Celia thought so.\r\n\r\n“I wonder you show temper, Dorothea.”\r\n\r\n“It is so painful in you, Celia, that you will look at human beings as\r\nif they were merely animals with a toilet, and never see the great soul\r\nin a man’s face.”\r\n\r\n“Has Mr. Casaubon a great soul?” Celia was not without a touch of naive\r\nmalice.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I believe he has,” said Dorothea, with the full voice of\r\ndecision. “Everything I see in him corresponds to his pamphlet on\r\nBiblical Cosmology.”\r\n\r\n“He talks very little,” said Celia\r\n\r\n“There is no one for him to talk to.”\r\n\r\nCelia thought privately, “Dorothea quite despises Sir James Chettam; I\r\nbelieve she would not accept him.” Celia felt that this was a pity. She\r\nhad never been deceived as to the object of the baronet’s interest.\r\nSometimes, indeed, she had reflected that Dodo would perhaps not make a\r\nhusband happy who had not her way of looking at things; and stifled in\r\nthe depths of her heart was the feeling that her sister was too\r\nreligious for family comfort. Notions and scruples were like spilt\r\nneedles, making one afraid of treading, or sitting down, or even\r\neating.\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Brooke was at the tea-table, Sir James came to sit down by\r\nher, not having felt her mode of answering him at all offensive. Why\r\nshould he? He thought it probable that Miss Brooke liked him, and\r\nmanners must be very marked indeed before they cease to be interpreted\r\nby preconceptions either confident or distrustful. She was thoroughly\r\ncharming to him, but of course he theorized a little about his\r\nattachment. He was made of excellent human dough, and had the rare\r\nmerit of knowing that his talents, even if let loose, would not set the\r\nsmallest stream in the county on fire: hence he liked the prospect of a\r\nwife to whom he could say, “What shall we do?” about this or that; who\r\ncould help her husband out with reasons, and would also have the\r\nproperty qualification for doing so. As to the excessive religiousness\r\nalleged against Miss Brooke, he had a very indefinite notion of what it\r\nconsisted in, and thought that it would die out with marriage. In\r\nshort, he felt himself to be in love in the right place, and was ready\r\nto endure a great deal of predominance, which, after all, a man could\r\nalways put down when he liked. Sir James had no idea that he should\r\never like to put down the predominance of this handsome girl, in whose\r\ncleverness he delighted. Why not? A man’s mind—what there is of it—has\r\nalways the advantage of being masculine,—as the smallest birch-tree is\r\nof a higher kind than the most soaring palm,—and even his ignorance is\r\nof a sounder quality. Sir James might not have originated this\r\nestimate; but a kind Providence furnishes the limpest personality with\r\na little gum or starch in the form of tradition.\r\n\r\n“Let me hope that you will rescind that resolution about the horse,\r\nMiss Brooke,” said the persevering admirer. “I assure you, riding is\r\nthe most healthy of exercises.”\r\n\r\n“I am aware of it,” said Dorothea, coldly. “I think it would do Celia\r\ngood—if she would take to it.”\r\n\r\n“But you are such a perfect horsewoman.”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me; I have had very little practice, and I should be easily\r\nthrown.”\r\n\r\n“Then that is a reason for more practice. Every lady ought to be a\r\nperfect horsewoman, that she may accompany her husband.”\r\n\r\n“You see how widely we differ, Sir James. I have made up my mind that I\r\nought not to be a perfect horsewoman, and so I should never correspond\r\nto your pattern of a lady.” Dorothea looked straight before her, and\r\nspoke with cold brusquerie, very much with the air of a handsome boy,\r\nin amusing contrast with the solicitous amiability of her admirer.\r\n\r\n“I should like to know your reasons for this cruel resolution. It is\r\nnot possible that you should think horsemanship wrong.”\r\n\r\n“It is quite possible that I should think it wrong for me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, why?” said Sir James, in a tender tone of remonstrance.\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon had come up to the table, teacup in hand, and was\r\nlistening.\r\n\r\n“We must not inquire too curiously into motives,” he interposed, in his\r\nmeasured way. “Miss Brooke knows that they are apt to become feeble in\r\nthe utterance: the aroma is mixed with the grosser air. We must keep\r\nthe germinating grain away from the light.”\r\n\r\nDorothea colored with pleasure, and looked up gratefully to the\r\nspeaker. Here was a man who could understand the higher inward life,\r\nand with whom there could be some spiritual communion; nay, who could\r\nilluminate principle with the widest knowledge: a man whose learning\r\nalmost amounted to a proof of whatever he believed!\r\n\r\nDorothea’s inferences may seem large; but really life could never have\r\ngone on at any period but for this liberal allowance of conclusions,\r\nwhich has facilitated marriage under the difficulties of civilization.\r\nHas any one ever pinched into its pilulous smallness the cobweb of\r\npre-matrimonial acquaintanceship?\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said good Sir James. “Miss Brooke shall not be urged to\r\ntell reasons she would rather be silent upon. I am sure her reasons\r\nwould do her honor.”\r\n\r\nHe was not in the least jealous of the interest with which Dorothea had\r\nlooked up at Mr. Casaubon: it never occurred to him that a girl to whom\r\nhe was meditating an offer of marriage could care for a dried bookworm\r\ntowards fifty, except, indeed, in a religious sort of way, as for a\r\nclergyman of some distinction.\r\n\r\nHowever, since Miss Brooke had become engaged in a conversation with\r\nMr. Casaubon about the Vaudois clergy, Sir James betook himself to\r\nCelia, and talked to her about her sister; spoke of a house in town,\r\nand asked whether Miss Brooke disliked London. Away from her sister,\r\nCelia talked quite easily, and Sir James said to himself that the\r\nsecond Miss Brooke was certainly very agreeable as well as pretty,\r\nthough not, as some people pretended, more clever and sensible than the\r\nelder sister. He felt that he had chosen the one who was in all\r\nrespects the superior; and a man naturally likes to look forward to\r\nhaving the best. He would be the very Mawworm of bachelors who\r\npretended not to expect it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n“Say, goddess, what ensued, when Raphael,\r\nThe affable archangel . . .\r\n                    Eve\r\nThe story heard attentive, and was filled\r\nWith admiration, and deep muse, to hear\r\nOf things so high and strange.”\r\n—_Paradise Lost_, B. vii.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it had really occurred to Mr. Casaubon to think of Miss Brooke as a\r\nsuitable wife for him, the reasons that might induce her to accept him\r\nwere already planted in her mind, and by the evening of the next day\r\nthe reasons had budded and bloomed. For they had had a long\r\nconversation in the morning, while Celia, who did not like the company\r\nof Mr. Casaubon’s moles and sallowness, had escaped to the vicarage to\r\nplay with the curate’s ill-shod but merry children.\r\n\r\nDorothea by this time had looked deep into the ungauged reservoir of\r\nMr. Casaubon’s mind, seeing reflected there in vague labyrinthine\r\nextension every quality she herself brought; had opened much of her own\r\nexperience to him, and had understood from him the scope of his great\r\nwork, also of attractively labyrinthine extent. For he had been as\r\ninstructive as Milton’s “affable archangel;” and with something of the\r\narchangelic manner he told her how he had undertaken to show (what\r\nindeed had been attempted before, but not with that thoroughness,\r\njustice of comparison, and effectiveness of arrangement at which Mr.\r\nCasaubon aimed) that all the mythical systems or erratic mythical\r\nfragments in the world were corruptions of a tradition originally\r\nrevealed. Having once mastered the true position and taken a firm\r\nfooting there, the vast field of mythical constructions became\r\nintelligible, nay, luminous with the reflected light of\r\ncorrespondences. But to gather in this great harvest of truth was no\r\nlight or speedy work. His notes already made a formidable range of\r\nvolumes, but the crowning task would be to condense these voluminous\r\nstill-accumulating results and bring them, like the earlier vintage of\r\nHippocratic books, to fit a little shelf. In explaining this to\r\nDorothea, Mr. Casaubon expressed himself nearly as he would have done\r\nto a fellow-student, for he had not two styles of talking at command:\r\nit is true that when he used a Greek or Latin phrase he always gave the\r\nEnglish with scrupulous care, but he would probably have done this in\r\nany case. A learned provincial clergyman is accustomed to think of his\r\nacquaintances as of “lords, knyghtes, and other noble and worthi men,\r\nthat conne Latyn but lytille.”\r\n\r\nDorothea was altogether captivated by the wide embrace of this\r\nconception. Here was something beyond the shallows of ladies’ school\r\nliterature: here was a living Bossuet, whose work would reconcile\r\ncomplete knowledge with devoted piety; here was a modern Augustine who\r\nunited the glories of doctor and saint.\r\n\r\nThe sanctity seemed no less clearly marked than the learning, for when\r\nDorothea was impelled to open her mind on certain themes which she\r\ncould speak of to no one whom she had before seen at Tipton, especially\r\non the secondary importance of ecclesiastical forms and articles of\r\nbelief compared with that spiritual religion, that submergence of self\r\nin communion with Divine perfection which seemed to her to be expressed\r\nin the best Christian books of widely distant ages, she found in Mr.\r\nCasaubon a listener who understood her at once, who could assure her of\r\nhis own agreement with that view when duly tempered with wise\r\nconformity, and could mention historical examples before unknown to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“He thinks with me,” said Dorothea to herself, “or rather, he thinks a\r\nwhole world of which my thought is but a poor twopenny mirror. And his\r\nfeelings too, his whole experience—what a lake compared with my little\r\npool!”\r\n\r\nMiss Brooke argued from words and dispositions not less unhesitatingly\r\nthan other young ladies of her age. Signs are small measurable things,\r\nbut interpretations are illimitable, and in girls of sweet, ardent\r\nnature, every sign is apt to conjure up wonder, hope, belief, vast as a\r\nsky, and colored by a diffused thimbleful of matter in the shape of\r\nknowledge. They are not always too grossly deceived; for Sinbad himself\r\nmay have fallen by good-luck on a true description, and wrong reasoning\r\nsometimes lands poor mortals in right conclusions: starting a long way\r\noff the true point, and proceeding by loops and zigzags, we now and\r\nthen arrive just where we ought to be. Because Miss Brooke was hasty in\r\nher trust, it is not therefore clear that Mr. Casaubon was unworthy of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHe stayed a little longer than he had intended, on a slight pressure of\r\ninvitation from Mr. Brooke, who offered no bait except his own\r\ndocuments on machine-breaking and rick-burning. Mr. Casaubon was called\r\ninto the library to look at these in a heap, while his host picked up\r\nfirst one and then the other to read aloud from in a skipping and\r\nuncertain way, passing from one unfinished passage to another with a\r\n“Yes, now, but here!” and finally pushing them all aside to open the\r\njournal of his youthful Continental travels.\r\n\r\n“Look here—here is all about Greece. Rhamnus, the ruins of Rhamnus—you\r\nare a great Grecian, now. I don’t know whether you have given much\r\nstudy to the topography. I spent no end of time in making out these\r\nthings—Helicon, now. Here, now!—‘We started the next morning for\r\nParnassus, the double-peaked Parnassus.’ All this volume is about\r\nGreece, you know,” Mr. Brooke wound up, rubbing his thumb transversely\r\nalong the edges of the leaves as he held the book forward.\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon made a dignified though somewhat sad audience; bowed in\r\nthe right place, and avoided looking at anything documentary as far as\r\npossible, without showing disregard or impatience; mindful that this\r\ndesultoriness was associated with the institutions of the country, and\r\nthat the man who took him on this severe mental scamper was not only an\r\namiable host, but a landholder and custos rotulorum. Was his endurance\r\naided also by the reflection that Mr. Brooke was the uncle of Dorothea?\r\n\r\nCertainly he seemed more and more bent on making her talk to him, on\r\ndrawing her out, as Celia remarked to herself; and in looking at her\r\nhis face was often lit up by a smile like pale wintry sunshine. Before\r\nhe left the next morning, while taking a pleasant walk with Miss Brooke\r\nalong the gravelled terrace, he had mentioned to her that he felt the\r\ndisadvantage of loneliness, the need of that cheerful companionship\r\nwith which the presence of youth can lighten or vary the serious toils\r\nof maturity. And he delivered this statement with as much careful\r\nprecision as if he had been a diplomatic envoy whose words would be\r\nattended with results. Indeed, Mr. Casaubon was not used to expect that\r\nhe should have to repeat or revise his communications of a practical or\r\npersonal kind. The inclinations which he had deliberately stated on the\r\n2d of October he would think it enough to refer to by the mention of\r\nthat date; judging by the standard of his own memory, which was a\r\nvolume where a vide supra could serve instead of repetitions, and not\r\nthe ordinary long-used blotting-book which only tells of forgotten\r\nwriting. But in this case Mr. Casaubon’s confidence was not likely to\r\nbe falsified, for Dorothea heard and retained what he said with the\r\neager interest of a fresh young nature to which every variety in\r\nexperience is an epoch.\r\n\r\nIt was three o’clock in the beautiful breezy autumn day when Mr.\r\nCasaubon drove off to his Rectory at Lowick, only five miles from\r\nTipton; and Dorothea, who had on her bonnet and shawl, hurried along\r\nthe shrubbery and across the park that she might wander through the\r\nbordering wood with no other visible companionship than that of Monk,\r\nthe Great St. Bernard dog, who always took care of the young ladies in\r\ntheir walks. There had risen before her the girl’s vision of a possible\r\nfuture for herself to which she looked forward with trembling hope, and\r\nshe wanted to wander on in that visionary future without interruption.\r\nShe walked briskly in the brisk air, the color rose in her cheeks, and\r\nher straw bonnet (which our contemporaries might look at with\r\nconjectural curiosity as at an obsolete form of basket) fell a little\r\nbackward. She would perhaps be hardly characterized enough if it were\r\nomitted that she wore her brown hair flatly braided and coiled behind\r\nso as to expose the outline of her head in a daring manner at a time\r\nwhen public feeling required the meagreness of nature to be\r\ndissimulated by tall barricades of frizzed curls and bows, never\r\nsurpassed by any great race except the Feejeean. This was a trait of\r\nMiss Brooke’s asceticism. But there was nothing of an ascetic’s\r\nexpression in her bright full eyes, as she looked before her, not\r\nconsciously seeing, but absorbing into the intensity of her mood, the\r\nsolemn glory of the afternoon with its long swathes of light between\r\nthe far-off rows of limes, whose shadows touched each other.\r\n\r\nAll people, young or old (that is, all people in those ante-reform\r\ntimes), would have thought her an interesting object if they had\r\nreferred the glow in her eyes and cheeks to the newly awakened ordinary\r\nimages of young love: the illusions of Chloe about Strephon have been\r\nsufficiently consecrated in poetry, as the pathetic loveliness of all\r\nspontaneous trust ought to be. Miss Pippin adoring young Pumpkin, and\r\ndreaming along endless vistas of unwearying companionship, was a little\r\ndrama which never tired our fathers and mothers, and had been put into\r\nall costumes. Let but Pumpkin have a figure which would sustain the\r\ndisadvantages of the shortwaisted swallow-tail, and everybody felt it\r\nnot only natural but necessary to the perfection of womanhood, that a\r\nsweet girl should be at once convinced of his virtue, his exceptional\r\nability, and above all, his perfect sincerity. But perhaps no persons\r\nthen living—certainly none in the neighborhood of Tipton—would have had\r\na sympathetic understanding for the dreams of a girl whose notions\r\nabout marriage took their color entirely from an exalted enthusiasm\r\nabout the ends of life, an enthusiasm which was lit chiefly by its own\r\nfire, and included neither the niceties of the trousseau, the pattern\r\nof plate, nor even the honors and sweet joys of the blooming matron.\r\n\r\nIt had now entered Dorothea’s mind that Mr. Casaubon might wish to make\r\nher his wife, and the idea that he would do so touched her with a sort\r\nof reverential gratitude. How good of him—nay, it would be almost as if\r\na winged messenger had suddenly stood beside her path and held out his\r\nhand towards her! For a long while she had been oppressed by the\r\nindefiniteness which hung in her mind, like a thick summer haze, over\r\nall her desire to make her life greatly effective. What could she do,\r\nwhat ought she to do?—she, hardly more than a budding woman, but yet\r\nwith an active conscience and a great mental need, not to be satisfied\r\nby a girlish instruction comparable to the nibblings and judgments of a\r\ndiscursive mouse. With some endowment of stupidity and conceit, she\r\nmight have thought that a Christian young lady of fortune should find\r\nher ideal of life in village charities, patronage of the humbler\r\nclergy, the perusal of “Female Scripture Characters,” unfolding the\r\nprivate experience of Sara under the Old Dispensation, and Dorcas under\r\nthe New, and the care of her soul over her embroidery in her own\r\nboudoir—with a background of prospective marriage to a man who, if less\r\nstrict than herself, as being involved in affairs religiously\r\ninexplicable, might be prayed for and seasonably exhorted. From such\r\ncontentment poor Dorothea was shut out. The intensity of her religious\r\ndisposition, the coercion it exercised over her life, was but one\r\naspect of a nature altogether ardent, theoretic, and intellectually\r\nconsequent: and with such a nature struggling in the bands of a narrow\r\nteaching, hemmed in by a social life which seemed nothing but a\r\nlabyrinth of petty courses, a walled-in maze of small paths that led no\r\nwhither, the outcome was sure to strike others as at once exaggeration\r\nand inconsistency. The thing which seemed to her best, she wanted to\r\njustify by the completest knowledge; and not to live in a pretended\r\nadmission of rules which were never acted on. Into this soul-hunger as\r\nyet all her youthful passion was poured; the union which attracted her\r\nwas one that would deliver her from her girlish subjection to her own\r\nignorance, and give her the freedom of voluntary submission to a guide\r\nwho would take her along the grandest path.\r\n\r\n“I should learn everything then,” she said to herself, still walking\r\nquickly along the bridle road through the wood. “It would be my duty to\r\nstudy that I might help him the better in his great works. There would\r\nbe nothing trivial about our lives. Every-day things with us would mean\r\nthe greatest things. It would be like marrying Pascal. I should learn\r\nto see the truth by the same light as great men have seen it by. And\r\nthen I should know what to do, when I got older: I should see how it\r\nwas possible to lead a grand life here—now—in England. I don’t feel\r\nsure about doing good in any way now: everything seems like going on a\r\nmission to a people whose language I don’t know;—unless it were\r\nbuilding good cottages—there can be no doubt about that. Oh, I hope I\r\nshould be able to get the people well housed in Lowick! I will draw\r\nplenty of plans while I have time.”\r\n\r\nDorothea checked herself suddenly with self-rebuke for the presumptuous\r\nway in which she was reckoning on uncertain events, but she was spared\r\nany inward effort to change the direction of her thoughts by the\r\nappearance of a cantering horseman round a turning of the road. The\r\nwell-groomed chestnut horse and two beautiful setters could leave no\r\ndoubt that the rider was Sir James Chettam. He discerned Dorothea,\r\njumped off his horse at once, and, having delivered it to his groom,\r\nadvanced towards her with something white on his arm, at which the two\r\nsetters were barking in an excited manner.\r\n\r\n“How delightful to meet you, Miss Brooke,” he said, raising his hat and\r\nshowing his sleekly waving blond hair. “It has hastened the pleasure I\r\nwas looking forward to.”\r\n\r\nMiss Brooke was annoyed at the interruption. This amiable baronet,\r\nreally a suitable husband for Celia, exaggerated the necessity of\r\nmaking himself agreeable to the elder sister. Even a prospective\r\nbrother-in-law may be an oppression if he will always be presupposing\r\ntoo good an understanding with you, and agreeing with you even when you\r\ncontradict him. The thought that he had made the mistake of paying his\r\naddresses to herself could not take shape: all her mental activity was\r\nused up in persuasions of another kind. But he was positively obtrusive\r\nat this moment, and his dimpled hands were quite disagreeable. Her\r\nroused temper made her color deeply, as she returned his greeting with\r\nsome haughtiness.\r\n\r\nSir James interpreted the heightened color in the way most gratifying\r\nto himself, and thought he never saw Miss Brooke looking so handsome.\r\n\r\n“I have brought a little petitioner,” he said, “or rather, I have\r\nbrought him to see if he will be approved before his petition is\r\noffered.” He showed the white object under his arm, which was a tiny\r\nMaltese puppy, one of nature’s most naive toys.\r\n\r\n“It is painful to me to see these creatures that are bred merely as\r\npets,” said Dorothea, whose opinion was forming itself that very moment\r\n(as opinions will) under the heat of irritation.\r\n\r\n“Oh, why?” said Sir James, as they walked forward.\r\n\r\n“I believe all the petting that is given them does not make them happy.\r\nThey are too helpless: their lives are too frail. A weasel or a mouse\r\nthat gets its own living is more interesting. I like to think that the\r\nanimals about us have souls something like our own, and either carry on\r\ntheir own little affairs or can be companions to us, like Monk here.\r\nThose creatures are parasitic.”\r\n\r\n“I am so glad I know that you do not like them,” said good Sir James.\r\n“I should never keep them for myself, but ladies usually are fond of\r\nthese Maltese dogs. Here, John, take this dog, will you?”\r\n\r\nThe objectionable puppy, whose nose and eyes were equally black and\r\nexpressive, was thus got rid of, since Miss Brooke decided that it had\r\nbetter not have been born. But she felt it necessary to explain.\r\n\r\n“You must not judge of Celia’s feeling from mine. I think she likes\r\nthese small pets. She had a tiny terrier once, which she was very fond\r\nof. It made me unhappy, because I was afraid of treading on it. I am\r\nrather short-sighted.”\r\n\r\n“You have your own opinion about everything, Miss Brooke, and it is\r\nalways a good opinion.”\r\n\r\nWhat answer was possible to such stupid complimenting?\r\n\r\n“Do you know, I envy you that,” Sir James said, as they continued\r\nwalking at the rather brisk pace set by Dorothea.\r\n\r\n“I don’t quite understand what you mean.”\r\n\r\n“Your power of forming an opinion. I can form an opinion of persons. I\r\nknow when I like people. But about other matters, do you know, I have\r\noften a difficulty in deciding. One hears very sensible things said on\r\nopposite sides.”\r\n\r\n“Or that seem sensible. Perhaps we don’t always discriminate between\r\nsense and nonsense.”\r\n\r\nDorothea felt that she was rather rude.\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said Sir James. “But you seem to have the power of\r\ndiscrimination.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, I am often unable to decide. But that is from\r\nignorance. The right conclusion is there all the same, though I am\r\nunable to see it.”\r\n\r\n“I think there are few who would see it more readily. Do you know,\r\nLovegood was telling me yesterday that you had the best notion in the\r\nworld of a plan for cottages—quite wonderful for a young lady, he\r\nthought. You had a real _genus_, to use his expression. He said you\r\nwanted Mr. Brooke to build a new set of cottages, but he seemed to\r\nthink it hardly probable that your uncle would consent. Do you know,\r\nthat is one of the things I wish to do—I mean, on my own estate. I\r\nshould be so glad to carry out that plan of yours, if you would let me\r\nsee it. Of course, it is sinking money; that is why people object to\r\nit. Laborers can never pay rent to make it answer. But, after all, it\r\nis worth doing.”\r\n\r\n“Worth doing! yes, indeed,” said Dorothea, energetically, forgetting\r\nher previous small vexations. “I think we deserve to be beaten out of\r\nour beautiful houses with a scourge of small cords—all of us who let\r\ntenants live in such sties as we see round us. Life in cottages might\r\nbe happier than ours, if they were real houses fit for human beings\r\nfrom whom we expect duties and affections.”\r\n\r\n“Will you show me your plan?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, certainly. I dare say it is very faulty. But I have been\r\nexamining all the plans for cottages in Loudon’s book, and picked out\r\nwhat seem the best things. Oh what a happiness it would be to set the\r\npattern about here! I think instead of Lazarus at the gate, we should\r\nput the pigsty cottages outside the park-gate.”\r\n\r\nDorothea was in the best temper now. Sir James, as brother in-law,\r\nbuilding model cottages on his estate, and then, perhaps, others being\r\nbuilt at Lowick, and more and more elsewhere in imitation—it would be\r\nas if the spirit of Oberlin had passed over the parishes to make the\r\nlife of poverty beautiful!\r\n\r\nSir James saw all the plans, and took one away to consult upon with\r\nLovegood. He also took away a complacent sense that he was making great\r\nprogress in Miss Brooke’s good opinion. The Maltese puppy was not\r\noffered to Celia; an omission which Dorothea afterwards thought of with\r\nsurprise; but she blamed herself for it. She had been engrossing Sir\r\nJames. After all, it was a relief that there was no puppy to tread\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nCelia was present while the plans were being examined, and observed Sir\r\nJames’s illusion. “He thinks that Dodo cares about him, and she only\r\ncares about her plans. Yet I am not certain that she would refuse him\r\nif she thought he would let her manage everything and carry out all her\r\nnotions. And how very uncomfortable Sir James would be! I cannot bear\r\nnotions.”\r\n\r\nIt was Celia’s private luxury to indulge in this dislike. She dared not\r\nconfess it to her sister in any direct statement, for that would be\r\nlaying herself open to a demonstration that she was somehow or other at\r\nwar with all goodness. But on safe opportunities, she had an indirect\r\nmode of making her negative wisdom tell upon Dorothea, and calling her\r\ndown from her rhapsodic mood by reminding her that people were staring,\r\nnot listening. Celia was not impulsive: what she had to say could wait,\r\nand came from her always with the same quiet staccato evenness. When\r\npeople talked with energy and emphasis she watched their faces and\r\nfeatures merely. She never could understand how well-bred persons\r\nconsented to sing and open their mouths in the ridiculous manner\r\nrequisite for that vocal exercise.\r\n\r\nIt was not many days before Mr. Casaubon paid a morning visit, on which\r\nhe was invited again for the following week to dine and stay the night.\r\nThus Dorothea had three more conversations with him, and was convinced\r\nthat her first impressions had been just. He was all she had at first\r\nimagined him to be: almost everything he had said seemed like a\r\nspecimen from a mine, or the inscription on the door of a museum which\r\nmight open on the treasures of past ages; and this trust in his mental\r\nwealth was all the deeper and more effective on her inclination because\r\nit was now obvious that his visits were made for her sake. This\r\naccomplished man condescended to think of a young girl, and take the\r\npains to talk to her, not with absurd compliment, but with an appeal to\r\nher understanding, and sometimes with instructive correction. What\r\ndelightful companionship! Mr. Casaubon seemed even unconscious that\r\ntrivialities existed, and never handed round that small-talk of heavy\r\nmen which is as acceptable as stale bride-cake brought forth with an\r\nodor of cupboard. He talked of what he was interested in, or else he\r\nwas silent and bowed with sad civility. To Dorothea this was adorable\r\ngenuineness, and religious abstinence from that artificiality which\r\nuses up the soul in the efforts of pretence. For she looked as\r\nreverently at Mr. Casaubon’s religious elevation above herself as she\r\ndid at his intellect and learning. He assented to her expressions of\r\ndevout feeling, and usually with an appropriate quotation; he allowed\r\nhimself to say that he had gone through some spiritual conflicts in his\r\nyouth; in short, Dorothea saw that here she might reckon on\r\nunderstanding, sympathy, and guidance. On one—only one—of her favorite\r\nthemes she was disappointed. Mr. Casaubon apparently did not care about\r\nbuilding cottages, and diverted the talk to the extremely narrow\r\naccommodation which was to be had in the dwellings of the ancient\r\nEgyptians, as if to check a too high standard. After he was gone,\r\nDorothea dwelt with some agitation on this indifference of his; and her\r\nmind was much exercised with arguments drawn from the varying\r\nconditions of climate which modify human needs, and from the admitted\r\nwickedness of pagan despots. Should she not urge these arguments on Mr.\r\nCasaubon when he came again? But further reflection told her that she\r\nwas presumptuous in demanding his attention to such a subject; he would\r\nnot disapprove of her occupying herself with it in leisure moments, as\r\nother women expected to occupy themselves with their dress and\r\nembroidery—would not forbid it when—Dorothea felt rather ashamed as she\r\ndetected herself in these speculations. But her uncle had been invited\r\nto go to Lowick to stay a couple of days: was it reasonable to suppose\r\nthat Mr. Casaubon delighted in Mr. Brooke’s society for its own sake,\r\neither with or without documents?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile that little disappointment made her delight the more in Sir\r\nJames Chettam’s readiness to set on foot the desired improvements. He\r\ncame much oftener than Mr. Casaubon, and Dorothea ceased to find him\r\ndisagreeable since he showed himself so entirely in earnest; for he had\r\nalready entered with much practical ability into Lovegood’s estimates,\r\nand was charmingly docile. She proposed to build a couple of cottages,\r\nand transfer two families from their old cabins, which could then be\r\npulled down, so that new ones could be built on the old sites. Sir\r\nJames said “Exactly,” and she bore the word remarkably well.\r\n\r\nCertainly these men who had so few spontaneous ideas might be very\r\nuseful members of society under good feminine direction, if they were\r\nfortunate in choosing their sisters-in-law! It is difficult to say\r\nwhether there was or was not a little wilfulness in her continuing\r\nblind to the possibility that another sort of choice was in question in\r\nrelation to her. But her life was just now full of hope and action: she\r\nwas not only thinking of her plans, but getting down learned books from\r\nthe library and reading many things hastily (that she might be a little\r\nless ignorant in talking to Mr. Casaubon), all the while being visited\r\nwith conscientious questionings whether she were not exalting these\r\npoor doings above measure and contemplating them with that\r\nself-satisfaction which was the last doom of ignorance and folly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n1_st Gent_. Our deeds are fetters that we forge ourselves.\r\n\r\n2_d Gent._ Ay, truly: but I think it is the world\r\nThat brings the iron.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sir James seems determined to do everything you wish,” said Celia, as\r\nthey were driving home from an inspection of the new building-site.\r\n\r\n“He is a good creature, and more sensible than any one would imagine,”\r\nsaid Dorothea, inconsiderately.\r\n\r\n“You mean that he appears silly.”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” said Dorothea, recollecting herself, and laying her hand on\r\nher sister’s a moment, “but he does not talk equally well on all\r\nsubjects.”\r\n\r\n“I should think none but disagreeable people do,” said Celia, in her\r\nusual purring way. “They must be very dreadful to live with. Only\r\nthink! at breakfast, and always.”\r\n\r\nDorothea laughed. “O Kitty, you are a wonderful creature!” She pinched\r\nCelia’s chin, being in the mood now to think her very winning and\r\nlovely—fit hereafter to be an eternal cherub, and if it were not\r\ndoctrinally wrong to say so, hardly more in need of salvation than a\r\nsquirrel. “Of course people need not be always talking well. Only one\r\ntells the quality of their minds when they try to talk well.”\r\n\r\n“You mean that Sir James tries and fails.”\r\n\r\n“I was speaking generally. Why do you catechise me about Sir James? It\r\nis not the object of his life to please me.”\r\n\r\n“Now, Dodo, can you really believe that?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. He thinks of me as a future sister—that is all.” Dorothea\r\nhad never hinted this before, waiting, from a certain shyness on such\r\nsubjects which was mutual between the sisters, until it should be\r\nintroduced by some decisive event. Celia blushed, but said at once—\r\n\r\n“Pray do not make that mistake any longer, Dodo. When Tantripp was\r\nbrushing my hair the other day, she said that Sir James’s man knew from\r\nMrs. Cadwallader’s maid that Sir James was to marry the eldest Miss\r\nBrooke.”\r\n\r\n“How can you let Tantripp talk such gossip to you, Celia?” said\r\nDorothea, indignantly, not the less angry because details asleep in her\r\nmemory were now awakened to confirm the unwelcome revelation. “You must\r\nhave asked her questions. It is degrading.”\r\n\r\n“I see no harm at all in Tantripp’s talking to me. It is better to hear\r\nwhat people say. You see what mistakes you make by taking up notions. I\r\nam quite sure that Sir James means to make you an offer; and he\r\nbelieves that you will accept him, especially since you have been so\r\npleased with him about the plans. And uncle too—I know he expects it.\r\nEvery one can see that Sir James is very much in love with you.”\r\n\r\nThe revulsion was so strong and painful in Dorothea’s mind that the\r\ntears welled up and flowed abundantly. All her dear plans were\r\nembittered, and she thought with disgust of Sir James’s conceiving that\r\nshe recognized him as her lover. There was vexation too on account of\r\nCelia.\r\n\r\n“How could he expect it?” she burst forth in her most impetuous manner.\r\n“I have never agreed with him about anything but the cottages: I was\r\nbarely polite to him before.”\r\n\r\n“But you have been so pleased with him since then; he has begun to feel\r\nquite sure that you are fond of him.”\r\n\r\n“Fond of him, Celia! How can you choose such odious expressions?” said\r\nDorothea, passionately.\r\n\r\n“Dear me, Dorothea, I suppose it would be right for you to be fond of a\r\nman whom you accepted for a husband.”\r\n\r\n“It is offensive to me to say that Sir James could think I was fond of\r\nhim. Besides, it is not the right word for the feeling I must have\r\ntowards the man I would accept as a husband.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I am sorry for Sir James. I thought it right to tell you,\r\nbecause you went on as you always do, never looking just where you are,\r\nand treading in the wrong place. You always see what nobody else sees;\r\nit is impossible to satisfy you; yet you never see what is quite plain.\r\nThat’s your way, Dodo.” Something certainly gave Celia unusual courage;\r\nand she was not sparing the sister of whom she was occasionally in awe.\r\nWho can tell what just criticisms Murr the Cat may be passing on us\r\nbeings of wider speculation?\r\n\r\n“It is very painful,” said Dorothea, feeling scourged. “I can have no\r\nmore to do with the cottages. I must be uncivil to him. I must tell him\r\nI will have nothing to do with them. It is very painful.” Her eyes\r\nfilled again with tears.\r\n\r\n“Wait a little. Think about it. You know he is going away for a day or\r\ntwo to see his sister. There will be nobody besides Lovegood.” Celia\r\ncould not help relenting. “Poor Dodo,” she went on, in an amiable\r\nstaccato. “It is very hard: it is your favorite _fad_ to draw plans.”\r\n\r\n“_Fad_ to draw plans! Do you think I only care about my\r\nfellow-creatures’ houses in that childish way? I may well make\r\nmistakes. How can one ever do anything nobly Christian, living among\r\npeople with such petty thoughts?”\r\n\r\nNo more was said; Dorothea was too much jarred to recover her temper\r\nand behave so as to show that she admitted any error in herself. She\r\nwas disposed rather to accuse the intolerable narrowness and the\r\npurblind conscience of the society around her: and Celia was no longer\r\nthe eternal cherub, but a thorn in her spirit, a pink-and-white\r\nnullifidian, worse than any discouraging presence in the “Pilgrim’s\r\nProgress.” The _fad_ of drawing plans! What was life worth—what great\r\nfaith was possible when the whole effect of one’s actions could be\r\nwithered up into such parched rubbish as that? When she got out of the\r\ncarriage, her cheeks were pale and her eyelids red. She was an image of\r\nsorrow, and her uncle who met her in the hall would have been alarmed,\r\nif Celia had not been close to her looking so pretty and composed, that\r\nhe at once concluded Dorothea’s tears to have their origin in her\r\nexcessive religiousness. He had returned, during their absence, from a\r\njourney to the county town, about a petition for the pardon of some\r\ncriminal.\r\n\r\n“Well, my dears,” he said, kindly, as they went up to kiss him, “I hope\r\nnothing disagreeable has happened while I have been away.”\r\n\r\n“No, uncle,” said Celia, “we have been to Freshitt to look at the\r\ncottages. We thought you would have been at home to lunch.”\r\n\r\n“I came by Lowick to lunch—you didn’t know I came by Lowick. And I have\r\nbrought a couple of pamphlets for you, Dorothea—in the library, you\r\nknow; they lie on the table in the library.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if an electric stream went through Dorothea, thrilling her\r\nfrom despair into expectation. They were pamphlets about the early\r\nChurch. The oppression of Celia, Tantripp, and Sir James was shaken\r\noff, and she walked straight to the library. Celia went up-stairs. Mr.\r\nBrooke was detained by a message, but when he re-entered the library,\r\nhe found Dorothea seated and already deep in one of the pamphlets which\r\nhad some marginal manuscript of Mr. Casaubon’s,—taking it in as eagerly\r\nas she might have taken in the scent of a fresh bouquet after a dry,\r\nhot, dreary walk.\r\n\r\nShe was getting away from Tipton and Freshitt, and her own sad\r\nliability to tread in the wrong places on her way to the New Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke sat down in his arm-chair, stretched his legs towards the\r\nwood-fire, which had fallen into a wondrous mass of glowing dice\r\nbetween the dogs, and rubbed his hands gently, looking very mildly\r\ntowards Dorothea, but with a neutral leisurely air, as if he had\r\nnothing particular to say. Dorothea closed her pamphlet, as soon as she\r\nwas aware of her uncle’s presence, and rose as if to go. Usually she\r\nwould have been interested about her uncle’s merciful errand on behalf\r\nof the criminal, but her late agitation had made her absent-minded.\r\n\r\n“I came back by Lowick, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, not as if with any\r\nintention to arrest her departure, but apparently from his usual\r\ntendency to say what he had said before. This fundamental principle of\r\nhuman speech was markedly exhibited in Mr. Brooke. “I lunched there and\r\nsaw Casaubon’s library, and that kind of thing. There’s a sharp air,\r\ndriving. Won’t you sit down, my dear? You look cold.”\r\n\r\nDorothea felt quite inclined to accept the invitation. Some times, when\r\nher uncle’s easy way of taking things did not happen to be\r\nexasperating, it was rather soothing. She threw off her mantle and\r\nbonnet, and sat down opposite to him, enjoying the glow, but lifting up\r\nher beautiful hands for a screen. They were not thin hands, or small\r\nhands; but powerful, feminine, maternal hands. She seemed to be holding\r\nthem up in propitiation for her passionate desire to know and to think,\r\nwhich in the unfriendly mediums of Tipton and Freshitt had issued in\r\ncrying and red eyelids.\r\n\r\nShe bethought herself now of the condemned criminal. “What news have\r\nyou brought about the sheep-stealer, uncle?”\r\n\r\n“What, poor Bunch?—well, it seems we can’t get him off—he is to be\r\nhanged.”\r\n\r\nDorothea’s brow took an expression of reprobation and pity.\r\n\r\n“Hanged, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, with a quiet nod. “Poor Romilly!\r\nhe would have helped us. I knew Romilly. Casaubon didn’t know Romilly.\r\nHe is a little buried in books, you know, Casaubon is.”\r\n\r\n“When a man has great studies and is writing a great work, he must of\r\ncourse give up seeing much of the world. How can he go about making\r\nacquaintances?”\r\n\r\n“That’s true. But a man mopes, you know. I have always been a bachelor\r\ntoo, but I have that sort of disposition that I never moped; it was my\r\nway to go about everywhere and take in everything. I never moped: but I\r\ncan see that Casaubon does, you know. He wants a companion—a companion,\r\nyou know.”\r\n\r\n“It would be a great honor to any one to be his companion,” said\r\nDorothea, energetically.\r\n\r\n“You like him, eh?” said Mr. Brooke, without showing any surprise, or\r\nother emotion. “Well, now, I’ve known Casaubon ten years, ever since he\r\ncame to Lowick. But I never got anything out of him—any ideas, you\r\nknow. However, he is a tiptop man and may be a bishop—that kind of\r\nthing, you know, if Peel stays in. And he has a very high opinion of\r\nyou, my dear.”\r\n\r\nDorothea could not speak.\r\n\r\n“The fact is, he has a very high opinion indeed of you. And he speaks\r\nuncommonly well—does Casaubon. He has deferred to me, you not being of\r\nage. In short, I have promised to speak to you, though I told him I\r\nthought there was not much chance. I was bound to tell him that. I\r\nsaid, my niece is very young, and that kind of thing. But I didn’t\r\nthink it necessary to go into everything. However, the long and the\r\nshort of it is, that he has asked my permission to make you an offer of\r\nmarriage—of marriage, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, with his explanatory\r\nnod. “I thought it better to tell you, my dear.”\r\n\r\nNo one could have detected any anxiety in Mr. Brooke’s manner, but he\r\ndid really wish to know something of his niece’s mind, that, if there\r\nwere any need for advice, he might give it in time. What feeling he, as\r\na magistrate who had taken in so many ideas, could make room for, was\r\nunmixedly kind. Since Dorothea did not speak immediately, he repeated,\r\n“I thought it better to tell you, my dear.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, uncle,” said Dorothea, in a clear unwavering tone. “I am\r\nvery grateful to Mr. Casaubon. If he makes me an offer, I shall accept\r\nhim. I admire and honor him more than any man I ever saw.”\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke paused a little, and then said in a lingering low tone, “Ah?\r\n… Well! He is a good match in some respects. But now, Chettam is a good\r\nmatch. And our land lies together. I shall never interfere against your\r\nwishes, my dear. People should have their own way in marriage, and that\r\nsort of thing—up to a certain point, you know. I have always said that,\r\nup to a certain point. I wish you to marry well; and I have good reason\r\nto believe that Chettam wishes to marry you. I mention it, you know.”\r\n\r\n“It is impossible that I should ever marry Sir James Chettam,” said\r\nDorothea. “If he thinks of marrying me, he has made a great mistake.”\r\n\r\n“That is it, you see. One never knows. I should have thought Chettam\r\nwas just the sort of man a woman would like, now.”\r\n\r\n“Pray do not mention him in that light again, uncle,” said Dorothea,\r\nfeeling some of her late irritation revive.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke wondered, and felt that women were an inexhaustible subject\r\nof study, since even he at his age was not in a perfect state of\r\nscientific prediction about them. Here was a fellow like Chettam with\r\nno chance at all.\r\n\r\n“Well, but Casaubon, now. There is no hurry—I mean for you. It’s true,\r\nevery year will tell upon him. He is over five-and-forty, you know. I\r\nshould say a good seven-and-twenty years older than you. To be sure,—if\r\nyou like learning and standing, and that sort of thing, we can’t have\r\neverything. And his income is good—he has a handsome property\r\nindependent of the Church—his income is good. Still he is not young,\r\nand I must not conceal from you, my dear, that I think his health is\r\nnot over-strong. I know nothing else against him.”\r\n\r\n“I should not wish to have a husband very near my own age,” said\r\nDorothea, with grave decision. “I should wish to have a husband who was\r\nabove me in judgment and in all knowledge.”\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke repeated his subdued, “Ah?—I thought you had more of your\r\nown opinion than most girls. I thought you liked your own opinion—liked\r\nit, you know.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot imagine myself living without some opinions, but I should\r\nwish to have good reasons for them, and a wise man could help me to see\r\nwhich opinions had the best foundation, and would help me to live\r\naccording to them.”\r\n\r\n“Very true. You couldn’t put the thing better—couldn’t put it better,\r\nbeforehand, you know. But there are oddities in things,” continued Mr.\r\nBrooke, whose conscience was really roused to do the best he could for\r\nhis niece on this occasion. “Life isn’t cast in a mould—not cut out by\r\nrule and line, and that sort of thing. I never married myself, and it\r\nwill be the better for you and yours. The fact is, I never loved any\r\none well enough to put myself into a noose for them. It _is_ a noose,\r\nyou know. Temper, now. There is temper. And a husband likes to be\r\nmaster.”\r\n\r\n“I know that I must expect trials, uncle. Marriage is a state of higher\r\nduties. I never thought of it as mere personal ease,” said poor\r\nDorothea.\r\n\r\n“Well, you are not fond of show, a great establishment, balls, dinners,\r\nthat kind of thing. I can see that Casaubon’s ways might suit you\r\nbetter than Chettam’s. And you shall do as you like, my dear. I would\r\nnot hinder Casaubon; I said so at once; for there is no knowing how\r\nanything may turn out. You have not the same tastes as every young\r\nlady; and a clergyman and scholar—who may be a bishop—that kind of\r\nthing—may suit you better than Chettam. Chettam is a good fellow, a\r\ngood sound-hearted fellow, you know; but he doesn’t go much into ideas.\r\nI did, when I was his age. But Casaubon’s eyes, now. I think he has\r\nhurt them a little with too much reading.”\r\n\r\n“I should be all the happier, uncle, the more room there was for me to\r\nhelp him,” said Dorothea, ardently.\r\n\r\n“You have quite made up your mind, I see. Well, my dear, the fact is, I\r\nhave a letter for you in my pocket.” Mr. Brooke handed the letter to\r\nDorothea, but as she rose to go away, he added, “There is not too much\r\nhurry, my dear. Think about it, you know.”\r\n\r\nWhen Dorothea had left him, he reflected that he had certainly spoken\r\nstrongly: he had put the risks of marriage before her in a striking\r\nmanner. It was his duty to do so. But as to pretending to be wise for\r\nyoung people,—no uncle, however much he had travelled in his youth,\r\nabsorbed the new ideas, and dined with celebrities now deceased, could\r\npretend to judge what sort of marriage would turn out well for a young\r\ngirl who preferred Casaubon to Chettam. In short, woman was a problem\r\nwhich, since Mr. Brooke’s mind felt blank before it, could be hardly\r\nless complicated than the revolutions of an irregular solid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n“Hard students are commonly troubled with gowts, catarrhs, rheums,\r\ncachexia, bradypepsia, bad eyes, stone, and collick, crudities,\r\noppilations, vertigo, winds, consumptions, and all such diseases as\r\ncome by over-much sitting: they are most part lean, dry, ill-colored …\r\nand all through immoderate pains and extraordinary studies. If you will\r\nnot believe the truth of this, look upon great Tostatus and Thomas\r\nAquinas’ works; and tell me whether those men took pains.”—BURTON’S\r\n_Anatomy of Melancholy_, P. I, s. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was Mr. Casaubon’s letter.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MISS BROOKE,—I have your guardian’s permission to address you\r\non a subject than which I have none more at heart. I am not, I trust,\r\nmistaken in the recognition of some deeper correspondence than that of\r\ndate in the fact that a consciousness of need in my own life had arisen\r\ncontemporaneously with the possibility of my becoming acquainted with\r\nyou. For in the first hour of meeting you, I had an impression of your\r\neminent and perhaps exclusive fitness to supply that need (connected, I\r\nmay say, with such activity of the affections as even the\r\npreoccupations of a work too special to be abdicated could not\r\nuninterruptedly dissimulate); and each succeeding opportunity for\r\nobservation has given the impression an added depth by convincing me\r\nmore emphatically of that fitness which I had preconceived, and thus\r\nevoking more decisively those affections to which I have but now\r\nreferred. Our conversations have, I think, made sufficiently clear to\r\nyou the tenor of my life and purposes: a tenor unsuited, I am aware, to\r\nthe commoner order of minds. But I have discerned in you an elevation\r\nof thought and a capability of devotedness, which I had hitherto not\r\nconceived to be compatible either with the early bloom of youth or with\r\nthose graces of sex that may be said at once to win and to confer\r\ndistinction when combined, as they notably are in you, with the mental\r\nqualities above indicated. It was, I confess, beyond my hope to meet\r\nwith this rare combination of elements both solid and attractive,\r\nadapted to supply aid in graver labors and to cast a charm over vacant\r\nhours; and but for the event of my introduction to you (which, let me\r\nagain say, I trust not to be superficially coincident with\r\nforeshadowing needs, but providentially related thereto as stages\r\ntowards the completion of a life’s plan), I should presumably have gone\r\non to the last without any attempt to lighten my solitariness by a\r\nmatrimonial union.\r\n    Such, my dear Miss Brooke, is the accurate statement of my\r\n    feelings; and I rely on your kind indulgence in venturing now to\r\n    ask you how far your own are of a nature to confirm my happy\r\n    presentiment. To be accepted by you as your husband and the earthly\r\n    guardian of your welfare, I should regard as the highest of\r\n    providential gifts. In return I can at least offer you an affection\r\n    hitherto unwasted, and the faithful consecration of a life which,\r\n    however short in the sequel, has no backward pages whereon, if you\r\n    choose to turn them, you will find records such as might justly\r\n    cause you either bitterness or shame. I await the expression of\r\n    your sentiments with an anxiety which it would be the part of\r\n    wisdom (were it possible) to divert by a more arduous labor than\r\n    usual. But in this order of experience I am still young, and in\r\n    looking forward to an unfavorable possibility I cannot but feel\r\n    that resignation to solitude will be more difficult after the\r\n    temporary illumination of hope.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn any case, I shall remain,\r\n    Yours with sincere devotion,\r\n        EDWARD CASAUBON.\r\n\r\n\r\nDorothea trembled while she read this letter; then she fell on her\r\nknees, buried her face, and sobbed. She could not pray: under the rush\r\nof solemn emotion in which thoughts became vague and images floated\r\nuncertainly, she could but cast herself, with a childlike sense of\r\nreclining, in the lap of a divine consciousness which sustained her\r\nown. She remained in that attitude till it was time to dress for\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nHow could it occur to her to examine the letter, to look at it\r\ncritically as a profession of love? Her whole soul was possessed by the\r\nfact that a fuller life was opening before her: she was a neophyte\r\nabout to enter on a higher grade of initiation. She was going to have\r\nroom for the energies which stirred uneasily under the dimness and\r\npressure of her own ignorance and the petty peremptoriness of the\r\nworld’s habits.\r\n\r\nNow she would be able to devote herself to large yet definite duties;\r\nnow she would be allowed to live continually in the light of a mind\r\nthat she could reverence. This hope was not unmixed with the glow of\r\nproud delight—the joyous maiden surprise that she was chosen by the man\r\nwhom her admiration had chosen. All Dorothea’s passion was transfused\r\nthrough a mind struggling towards an ideal life; the radiance of her\r\ntransfigured girlhood fell on the first object that came within its\r\nlevel. The impetus with which inclination became resolution was\r\nheightened by those little events of the day which had roused her\r\ndiscontent with the actual conditions of her life.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, when Celia was playing an “air, with variations,” a small\r\nkind of tinkling which symbolized the aesthetic part of the young\r\nladies’ education, Dorothea went up to her room to answer Mr.\r\nCasaubon’s letter. Why should she defer the answer? She wrote it over\r\nthree times, not because she wished to change the wording, but because\r\nher hand was unusually uncertain, and she could not bear that Mr.\r\nCasaubon should think her handwriting bad and illegible. She piqued\r\nherself on writing a hand in which each letter was distinguishable\r\nwithout any large range of conjecture, and she meant to make much use\r\nof this accomplishment, to save Mr. Casaubon’s eyes. Three times she\r\nwrote.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. CASAUBON,—I am very grateful to you for loving me, and\r\nthinking me worthy to be your wife. I can look forward to no better\r\nhappiness than that which would be one with yours. If I said more, it\r\nwould only be the same thing written out at greater length, for I\r\ncannot now dwell on any other thought than that I may be through life\r\n\r\n\r\nYours devotedly,\r\n    DOROTHEA BROOKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nLater in the evening she followed her uncle into the library to give\r\nhim the letter, that he might send it in the morning. He was surprised,\r\nbut his surprise only issued in a few moments’ silence, during which he\r\npushed about various objects on his writing-table, and finally stood\r\nwith his back to the fire, his glasses on his nose, looking at the\r\naddress of Dorothea’s letter.\r\n\r\n“Have you thought enough about this, my dear?” he said at last.\r\n\r\n“There was no need to think long, uncle. I know of nothing to make me\r\nvacillate. If I changed my mind, it must be because of something\r\nimportant and entirely new to me.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!—then you have accepted him? Then Chettam has no chance? Has\r\nChettam offended you—offended you, you know? What is it you don’t like\r\nin Chettam?”\r\n\r\n“There is nothing that I like in him,” said Dorothea, rather\r\nimpetuously.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke threw his head and shoulders backward as if some one had\r\nthrown a light missile at him. Dorothea immediately felt some\r\nself-rebuke, and said—\r\n\r\n“I mean in the light of a husband. He is very kind, I think—really very\r\ngood about the cottages. A well-meaning man.”\r\n\r\n“But you must have a scholar, and that sort of thing? Well, it lies a\r\nlittle in our family. I had it myself—that love of knowledge, and going\r\ninto everything—a little too much—it took me too far; though that sort\r\nof thing doesn’t often run in the female-line; or it runs underground\r\nlike the rivers in Greece, you know—it comes out in the sons. Clever\r\nsons, clever mothers. I went a good deal into that, at one time.\r\nHowever, my dear, I have always said that people should do as they like\r\nin these things, up to a certain point. I couldn’t, as your guardian,\r\nhave consented to a bad match. But Casaubon stands well: his position\r\nis good. I am afraid Chettam will be hurt, though, and Mrs. Cadwallader\r\nwill blame me.”\r\n\r\nThat evening, of course, Celia knew nothing of what had happened. She\r\nattributed Dorothea’s abstracted manner, and the evidence of further\r\ncrying since they had got home, to the temper she had been in about Sir\r\nJames Chettam and the buildings, and was careful not to give further\r\noffence: having once said what she wanted to say, Celia had no\r\ndisposition to recur to disagreeable subjects. It had been her nature\r\nwhen a child never to quarrel with any one—only to observe with wonder\r\nthat they quarrelled with her, and looked like turkey-cocks; whereupon\r\nshe was ready to play at cat’s cradle with them whenever they recovered\r\nthemselves. And as to Dorothea, it had always been her way to find\r\nsomething wrong in her sister’s words, though Celia inwardly protested\r\nthat she always said just how things were, and nothing else: she never\r\ndid and never could put words together out of her own head. But the\r\nbest of Dodo was, that she did not keep angry for long together. Now,\r\nthough they had hardly spoken to each other all the evening, yet when\r\nCelia put by her work, intending to go to bed, a proceeding in which\r\nshe was always much the earlier, Dorothea, who was seated on a low\r\nstool, unable to occupy herself except in meditation, said, with the\r\nmusical intonation which in moments of deep but quiet feeling made her\r\nspeech like a fine bit of recitative—\r\n\r\n“Celia, dear, come and kiss me,” holding her arms open as she spoke.\r\n\r\nCelia knelt down to get the right level and gave her little butterfly\r\nkiss, while Dorothea encircled her with gentle arms and pressed her\r\nlips gravely on each cheek in turn.\r\n\r\n“Don’t sit up, Dodo, you are so pale to-night: go to bed soon,” said\r\nCelia, in a comfortable way, without any touch of pathos.\r\n\r\n“No, dear, I am very, very happy,” said Dorothea, fervently.\r\n\r\n“So much the better,” thought Celia. “But how strangely Dodo goes from\r\none extreme to the other.”\r\n\r\nThe next day, at luncheon, the butler, handing something to Mr. Brooke,\r\nsaid, “Jonas is come back, sir, and has brought this letter.”\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke read the letter, and then, nodding toward Dorothea, said,\r\n“Casaubon, my dear: he will be here to dinner; he didn’t wait to write\r\nmore—didn’t wait, you know.”\r\n\r\nIt could not seem remarkable to Celia that a dinner guest should be\r\nannounced to her sister beforehand, but, her eyes following the same\r\ndirection as her uncle’s, she was struck with the peculiar effect of\r\nthe announcement on Dorothea. It seemed as if something like the\r\nreflection of a white sunlit wing had passed across her features,\r\nending in one of her rare blushes. For the first time it entered into\r\nCelia’s mind that there might be something more between Mr. Casaubon\r\nand her sister than his delight in bookish talk and her delight in\r\nlistening. Hitherto she had classed the admiration for this “ugly” and\r\nlearned acquaintance with the admiration for Monsieur Liret at\r\nLausanne, also ugly and learned. Dorothea had never been tired of\r\nlistening to old Monsieur Liret when Celia’s feet were as cold as\r\npossible, and when it had really become dreadful to see the skin of his\r\nbald head moving about. Why then should her enthusiasm not extend to\r\nMr. Casaubon simply in the same way as to Monsieur Liret? And it seemed\r\nprobable that all learned men had a sort of schoolmaster’s view of\r\nyoung people.\r\n\r\nBut now Celia was really startled at the suspicion which had darted\r\ninto her mind. She was seldom taken by surprise in this way, her\r\nmarvellous quickness in observing a certain order of signs generally\r\npreparing her to expect such outward events as she had an interest in.\r\nNot that she now imagined Mr. Casaubon to be already an accepted lover:\r\nshe had only begun to feel disgust at the possibility that anything in\r\nDorothea’s mind could tend towards such an issue. Here was something\r\nreally to vex her about Dodo: it was all very well not to accept Sir\r\nJames Chettam, but the idea of marrying Mr. Casaubon! Celia felt a sort\r\nof shame mingled with a sense of the ludicrous. But perhaps Dodo, if\r\nshe were really bordering on such an extravagance, might be turned away\r\nfrom it: experience had often shown that her impressibility might be\r\ncalculated on. The day was damp, and they were not going to walk out,\r\nso they both went up to their sitting-room; and there Celia observed\r\nthat Dorothea, instead of settling down with her usual diligent\r\ninterest to some occupation, simply leaned her elbow on an open book\r\nand looked out of the window at the great cedar silvered with the damp.\r\nShe herself had taken up the making of a toy for the curate’s children,\r\nand was not going to enter on any subject too precipitately.\r\n\r\nDorothea was in fact thinking that it was desirable for Celia to know\r\nof the momentous change in Mr. Casaubon’s position since he had last\r\nbeen in the house: it did not seem fair to leave her in ignorance of\r\nwhat would necessarily affect her attitude towards him; but it was\r\nimpossible not to shrink from telling her. Dorothea accused herself of\r\nsome meanness in this timidity: it was always odious to her to have any\r\nsmall fears or contrivances about her actions, but at this moment she\r\nwas seeking the highest aid possible that she might not dread the\r\ncorrosiveness of Celia’s pretty carnally minded prose. Her reverie was\r\nbroken, and the difficulty of decision banished, by Celia’s small and\r\nrather guttural voice speaking in its usual tone, of a remark aside or\r\na “by the bye.”\r\n\r\n“Is any one else coming to dine besides Mr. Casaubon?”\r\n\r\n“Not that I know of.”\r\n\r\n“I hope there is some one else. Then I shall not hear him eat his soup\r\nso.”\r\n\r\n“What is there remarkable about his soup-eating?”\r\n\r\n“Really, Dodo, can’t you hear how he scrapes his spoon? And he always\r\nblinks before he speaks. I don’t know whether Locke blinked, but I’m\r\nsure I am sorry for those who sat opposite to him if he did.”\r\n\r\n“Celia,” said Dorothea, with emphatic gravity, “pray don’t make any\r\nmore observations of that kind.”\r\n\r\n“Why not? They are quite true,” returned Celia, who had her reasons for\r\npersevering, though she was beginning to be a little afraid.\r\n\r\n“Many things are true which only the commonest minds observe.”\r\n\r\n“Then I think the commonest minds must be rather useful. I think it is\r\na pity Mr. Casaubon’s mother had not a commoner mind: she might have\r\ntaught him better.” Celia was inwardly frightened, and ready to run\r\naway, now she had hurled this light javelin.\r\n\r\nDorothea’s feelings had gathered to an avalanche, and there could be no\r\nfurther preparation.\r\n\r\n“It is right to tell you, Celia, that I am engaged to marry Mr.\r\nCasaubon.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps Celia had never turned so pale before. The paper man she was\r\nmaking would have had his leg injured, but for her habitual care of\r\nwhatever she held in her hands. She laid the fragile figure down at\r\nonce, and sat perfectly still for a few moments. When she spoke there\r\nwas a tear gathering.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Dodo, I hope you will be happy.” Her sisterly tenderness could not\r\nbut surmount other feelings at this moment, and her fears were the\r\nfears of affection.\r\n\r\nDorothea was still hurt and agitated.\r\n\r\n“It is quite decided, then?” said Celia, in an awed under tone. “And\r\nuncle knows?”\r\n\r\n“I have accepted Mr. Casaubon’s offer. My uncle brought me the letter\r\nthat contained it; he knew about it beforehand.”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon, if I have said anything to hurt you, Dodo,” said\r\nCelia, with a slight sob. She never could have thought that she should\r\nfeel as she did. There was something funereal in the whole affair, and\r\nMr. Casaubon seemed to be the officiating clergyman, about whom it\r\nwould be indecent to make remarks.\r\n\r\n“Never mind, Kitty, do not grieve. We should never admire the same\r\npeople. I often offend in something of the same way; I am apt to speak\r\ntoo strongly of those who don’t please me.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of this magnanimity Dorothea was still smarting: perhaps as\r\nmuch from Celia’s subdued astonishment as from her small criticisms. Of\r\ncourse all the world round Tipton would be out of sympathy with this\r\nmarriage. Dorothea knew of no one who thought as she did about life and\r\nits best objects.\r\n\r\nNevertheless before the evening was at an end she was very happy. In an\r\nhour’s _tête-à-tête_ with Mr. Casaubon she talked to him with more\r\nfreedom than she had ever felt before, even pouring out her joy at the\r\nthought of devoting herself to him, and of learning how she might best\r\nshare and further all his great ends. Mr. Casaubon was touched with an\r\nunknown delight (what man would not have been?) at this childlike\r\nunrestrained ardor: he was not surprised (what lover would have been?)\r\nthat he should b"

At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste,\r\nsomething eminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which\r\nnever found its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these\r\nsilent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in\r\nthe acts of his life. He was austere with himself; drank gin when he\r\nwas alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the\r\ntheatre, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But he had\r\nan approved tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with\r\nenvy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and\r\nin any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove. “I incline to\r\nCain’s heresy,” he used to say quaintly: “I let my brother go to the\r\ndevil in his own way.” In this character, it was frequently his fortune\r\nto be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in\r\nthe lives of downgoing men. And to such as these, so long as they came\r\nabout his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrative\r\nat the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar\r\ncatholicity of good-nature. It is the mark of a modest man to accept\r\nhis friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that\r\nwas the lawyer’s way. His friends were those of his own blood or those\r\nwhom he had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the\r\ngrowth of time, they implied no aptness in the object. Hence, no doubt\r\nthe bond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman,\r\nthe well-known man about town. It was a nut to crack for many, what\r\nthese two could see in each other, or what subject they could find in\r\ncommon. It was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday\r\nwalks, that they said nothing, looked singularly dull and would hail\r\nwith obvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two\r\nmen put the greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chief\r\njewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure, but\r\neven resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy them\r\nuninterrupted.\r\n\r\nIt chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a\r\nby-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small and what is\r\ncalled quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. The\r\ninhabitants were all doing well, it seemed, and all emulously hoping to\r\ndo better still, and laying out the surplus of their gains in coquetry;\r\nso that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of\r\ninvitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen. Even on Sunday, when it\r\nveiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of passage,\r\nthe street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood, like a fire\r\nin a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters, well-polished\r\nbrasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note, instantly caught\r\nand pleased the eye of the passenger.\r\n\r\nTwo doors from one corner, on the left hand going east the line was\r\nbroken by the entry of a court; and just at that point a certain\r\nsinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street. It\r\nwas two storeys high; showed no window, nothing but a door on the lower\r\nstorey and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper; and bore\r\nin every feature, the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence. The\r\ndoor, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blistered\r\nand distained. Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on\r\nthe panels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy had tried\r\nhis knife on the mouldings; and for close on a generation, no one had\r\nappeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their\r\nravages.\r\n\r\nMr. Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street; but\r\nwhen they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his cane and\r\npointed.\r\n\r\n“Did you ever remark that door?” he asked; and when his companion had\r\nreplied in the affirmative, “It is connected in my mind,” added he,\r\n“with a very odd story.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” said Mr. Utterson, with a slight change of voice, “and what\r\nwas that?”\r\n\r\n“Well, it was this way,” returned Mr. Enfield: “I was coming home from\r\nsome place at the end of the world, about three o’clock of a black\r\nwinter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was\r\nliterally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street after street and all the\r\nfolks asleep—street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession\r\nand all as empty as a church—till at last I got into that state of mind\r\nwhen a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a\r\npoliceman. All at once, I saw two figures: one a little man who was\r\nstumping along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybe\r\neight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross\r\nstreet. Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at the\r\ncorner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the man\r\ntrampled calmly over the child’s body and left her screaming on the\r\nground. It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see. It wasn’t\r\nlike a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut. I gave a few halloa,\r\ntook to my heels, collared my gentleman, and brought him back to where\r\nthere was already quite a group about the screaming child. He was\r\nperfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so ugly\r\nthat it brought out the sweat on me like running. The people who had\r\nturned out were the girl’s own family; and pretty soon, the doctor, for\r\nwhom she had been sent, put in his appearance. Well, the child was not\r\nmuch the worse, more frightened, according to the sawbones; and there\r\nyou might have supposed would be an end to it. But there was one\r\ncurious circumstance. I had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first\r\nsight. So had the child’s family, which was only natural. But the\r\ndoctor’s case was what struck me. He was the usual cut and dry\r\napothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh\r\naccent and about as emotional as a bagpipe. Well, sir, he was like the\r\nrest of us; every time he looked at my prisoner, I saw that sawbones\r\nturn sick and white with the desire to kill him. I knew what was in his\r\nmind, just as he knew what was in mine; and killing being out of the\r\nquestion, we did the next best. We told the man we could and would make\r\nsuch a scandal out of this as should make his name stink from one end\r\nof London to the other. If he had any friends or any credit, we\r\nundertook that he should lose them. And all the time, as we were\r\npitching it in red hot, we were keeping the women off him as best we\r\ncould for they were as wild as harpies. I never saw a circle of such\r\nhateful faces; and there was the man in the middle, with a kind of\r\nblack sneering coolness—frightened too, I could see that—but carrying\r\nit off, sir, really like Satan. ‘If you choose to make capital out of\r\nthis accident,’ said he, ‘I am naturally helpless. No gentleman but\r\nwishes to avoid a scene,’ says he. ‘Name your figure.’ Well, we screwed\r\nhim up to a hundred pounds for the child’s family; he would have\r\nclearly liked to stick out; but there was something about the lot of us\r\nthat meant mischief, and at last he struck. The next thing was to get\r\nthe money; and where do you think he carried us but to that place with\r\nthe door?—whipped out a key, went in, and presently came back with the\r\nmatter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Coutts’s,\r\ndrawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that I can’t mention,\r\nthough it’s one of the points of my story, but it was a name at least\r\nvery well known and often printed. The figure was stiff; but the\r\nsignature was good for more than that if it was only genuine. I took\r\nthe liberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole business\r\nlooked apocryphal, and that a man does not, in real life, walk into a\r\ncellar door at four in the morning and come out with another man’s\r\ncheque for close upon a hundred pounds. But he was quite easy and\r\nsneering. ‘Set your mind at rest,’ says he, ‘I will stay with you till\r\nthe banks open and cash the cheque myself.’ So we all set off, the\r\ndoctor, and the child’s father, and our friend and myself, and passed\r\nthe rest of the night in my chambers; and next day, when we had\r\nbreakfasted, went in a body to the bank. I gave in the cheque myself,\r\nand said I had every reason to believe it was a forgery. Not a bit of\r\nit. The cheque was genuine.”\r\n\r\n“Tut-tut!” said Mr. Utterson.\r\n\r\n“I see you feel as I do,” said Mr. Enfield. “Yes, it’s a bad story. For\r\nmy man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a really\r\ndamnable man; and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink of\r\nthe proprieties, celebrated too, and (what makes it worse) one of your\r\nfellows who do what they call good. Blackmail, I suppose; an honest man\r\npaying through the nose for some of the capers of his youth. Black Mail\r\nHouse is what I call the place with the door, in consequence. Though\r\neven that, you know, is far from explaining all,” he added, and with\r\nthe words fell into a vein of musing.\r\n\r\nFrom this he was recalled by Mr. Utterson asking rather suddenly: “And\r\nyou don’t know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?”\r\n\r\n“A likely place, isn’t it?” returned Mr. Enfield. “But I happen to have\r\nnoticed his address; he lives in some square or other.”\r\n\r\n“And you never asked about the—place with the door?” said Mr. Utterson.\r\n\r\n“No, sir; I had a delicacy,” was the reply. “I feel very strongly about\r\nputting questions; it partakes too much of the style of the day of\r\njudgment. You start a question, and it’s like starting a stone. You sit\r\nquietly on the top of a hill; and away the stone goes, starting others;\r\nand presently some bland old bird (the last you would have thought of)\r\nis knocked on the head in his own back garden and the family have to\r\nchange their name. No sir, I make it a rule of mine: the more it looks\r\nlike Queer Street, the less I ask.”\r\n\r\n“A very good rule, too,” said the lawyer.\r\n\r\n“But I have studied the place for myself,” continued Mr. Enfield. “It\r\nseems scarcely a house. There is no other door, and nobody goes in or\r\nout of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of my\r\nadventure. There are three windows looking on the court on the first\r\nfloor; none below; the windows are always shut but they’re clean. And\r\nthen there is a chimney which is generally smoking; so somebody must\r\nlive there. And yet it’s not so sure; for the buildings are so packed\r\ntogether about the court, that it’s hard to say where one ends and\r\nanother begins.”\r\n\r\nThe pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then “Enfield,”\r\nsaid Mr. Utterson, “that’s a good rule of yours.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I think it is,” returned Enfield.\r\n\r\n“But for all that,” continued the lawyer, “there’s one point I want to\r\nask. I want to ask the name of that man who walked over the child.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Mr. Enfield, “I can’t see what harm it would do. It was a\r\nman of the name of Hyde.”\r\n\r\n“Hm,” said Mr. Utterson. “What sort of a man is he to see?”\r\n\r\n“He is not easy to describe. There is something wrong with his\r\nappearance; something displeasing, something down-right detestable. I\r\nnever saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know why. He must be\r\ndeformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although I\r\ncouldn’t specify the point. He’s an extraordinary looking man, and yet\r\nI really can name nothing out of the way. No, sir; I can make no hand\r\nof it; I can’t describe him. And it’s not want of memory; for I declare\r\nI can see him this moment.”\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a\r\nweight of consideration. “You are sure he used a key?” he inquired at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n“My dear sir...” began Enfield, surprised out of himself.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know,” said Utterson; “I know it must seem strange. The fact\r\nis, if I do not ask you the name of the other party, it is because I\r\nknow it already. You see, Richard, your tale has gone home. If you have\r\nbeen inexact in any point you had better correct it.”\r\n\r\n“I think you might have warned me,” returned the other with a touch of\r\nsullenness. “But I have been pedantically exact, as you call it. The\r\nfellow had a key; and what’s more, he has it still. I saw him use it\r\nnot a week ago.”\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson sighed deeply but said never a word; and the young man\r\npresently resumed. “Here is another lesson to say nothing,” said he. “I\r\nam ashamed of my long tongue. Let us make a bargain never to refer to\r\nthis again.”\r\n\r\n“With all my heart,” said the lawyer. “I shake hands on that, Richard.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEARCH FOR MR. HYDE\r\n\r\nThat evening Mr. Utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombre\r\nspirits and sat down to dinner without relish. It was his custom of a\r\nSunday, when this meal was over, to sit close by the fire, a volume of\r\nsome dry divinity on his reading desk, until the clock of the\r\nneighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve, when he would go\r\nsoberly and gratefully to bed. On this night however, as soon as the\r\ncloth was taken away, he took up a candle and went into his business\r\nroom. There he opened his safe, took from the most private part of it a\r\ndocument endorsed on the envelope as Dr. Jekyll’s Will and sat down\r\nwith a clouded brow to study its contents. The will was holograph, for\r\nMr. Utterson though he took charge of it now that it was made, had\r\nrefused to lend the least assistance in the making of it; it provided\r\nnot only that, in case of the decease of Henry Jekyll, M.D., D.C.L.,\r\nL.L.D., F.R.S., etc., all his possessions were to pass into the hands\r\nof his “friend and benefactor Edward Hyde,” but that in case of Dr.\r\nJekyll’s “disappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding\r\nthree calendar months,” the said Edward Hyde should step into the said\r\nHenry Jekyll’s shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or\r\nobligation beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the\r\ndoctor’s household. This document had long been the lawyer’s eyesore.\r\nIt offended him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and\r\ncustomary sides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest. And\r\nhitherto it was his ignorance of Mr. Hyde that had swelled his\r\nindignation; now, by a sudden turn, it was his knowledge. It was\r\nalready bad enough when the name was but a name of which he could learn\r\nno more. It was worse when it began to be clothed upon with detestable\r\nattributes; and out of the shifting, insubstantial mists that had so\r\nlong baffled his eye, there leaped up the sudden, definite presentment\r\nof a fiend.\r\n\r\n“I thought it was madness,” he said, as he replaced the obnoxious paper\r\nin the safe, “and now I begin to fear it is disgrace.”\r\n\r\nWith that he blew out his candle, put on a greatcoat, and set forth in\r\nthe direction of Cavendish Square, that citadel of medicine, where his\r\nfriend, the great Dr. Lanyon, had his house and received his crowding\r\npatients. “If anyone knows, it will be Lanyon,” he had thought.\r\n\r\nThe solemn butler knew and welcomed him; he was subjected to no stage\r\nof delay, but ushered direct from the door to the dining-room where Dr.\r\nLanyon sat alone over his wine. This was a hearty, healthy, dapper,\r\nred-faced gentleman, with a shock of hair prematurely white, and a\r\nboisterous and decided manner. At sight of Mr. Utterson, he sprang up\r\nfrom his chair and welcomed him with both hands. The geniality, as was\r\nthe way of the man, was somewhat theatrical to the eye; but it reposed\r\non genuine feeling. For these two were old friends, old mates both at\r\nschool and college, both thorough respectors of themselves and of each\r\nother, and what does not always follow, men who thoroughly enjoyed each\r\nother’s company.\r\n\r\nAfter a little rambling talk, the lawyer led up to the subject which so\r\ndisagreeably preoccupied his mind.\r\n\r\n“I suppose, Lanyon,” said he, “you and I must be the two oldest friends\r\nthat Henry Jekyll has?”\r\n\r\n“I wish the friends were younger,” chuckled Dr. Lanyon. “But I suppose\r\nwe are. And what of that? I see little of him now.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” said Utterson. “I thought you had a bond of common interest.”\r\n\r\n“We had,” was the reply. “But it is more than ten years since Henry\r\nJekyll became too fanciful for me. He began to go wrong, wrong in mind;\r\nand though of course I continue to take an interest in him for old\r\nsake’s sake, as they say, I see and I have seen devilish little of the\r\nman. Such unscientific balderdash,” added the doctor, flushing suddenly\r\npurple, “would have estranged Damon and Pythias.”\r\n\r\nThis little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr. Utterson.\r\n“They have only differed on some point of science,” he thought; and\r\nbeing a man of no scientific passions (except in the matter of\r\nconveyancing), he even added: “It is nothing worse than that!” He gave\r\nhis friend a few seconds to recover his composure, and then approached\r\nthe question he had come to put. “Did you ever come across a _protégé_\r\nof his—one Hyde?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Hyde?” repeated Lanyon. “No. Never heard of him. Since my time.”\r\n\r\nThat was the amount of information that the lawyer carried back with\r\nhim to the great, dark bed on which he tossed to and fro, until the\r\nsmall hours of the morning began to grow large. It was a night of\r\nlittle ease to his toiling mind, toiling in mere darkness and besieged\r\nby questions.\r\n\r\nSix o’clock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently\r\nnear to Mr. Utterson’s dwelling, and still he was digging at the\r\nproblem. Hitherto it had touched him on the intellectual side alone;\r\nbut now his imagination also was engaged, or rather enslaved; and as he\r\nlay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained\r\nroom, Mr. Enfield’s tale went by before his mind in a scroll of lighted\r\npictures. He would be aware of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal\r\ncity; then of the figure of a man walking swiftly; then of a child\r\nrunning from the doctor’s; and then these met, and that human\r\nJuggernaut trod the child down and passed on regardless of her screams.\r\nOr else he would see a room in a rich house, where his friend lay\r\nasleep, dreaming and smiling at his dreams; and then the door of that\r\nroom would be opened, the curtains of the bed plucked apart, the\r\nsleeper recalled, and lo! there would stand by his side a figure to\r\nwhom power was given, and even at that dead hour, he must rise and do\r\nits bidding. The figure in these two phases haunted the lawyer all\r\nnight; and if at any time he dozed over, it was but to see it glide\r\nmore stealthily through sleeping houses, or move the more swiftly and\r\nstill the more swiftly, even to dizziness, through wider labyrinths of\r\nlamplighted city, and at every street corner crush a child and leave\r\nher screaming. And still the figure had no face by which he might know\r\nit; even in his dreams, it had no face, or one that baffled him and\r\nmelted before his eyes; and thus it was that there sprang up and grew\r\napace in the lawyer’s mind a singularly strong, almost an inordinate,\r\ncuriosity to behold the features of the real Mr. Hyde. If he could but\r\nonce set eyes on him, he thought the mystery would lighten and perhaps\r\nroll altogether away, as was the habit of mysterious things when well\r\nexamined. He might see a reason for his friend’s strange preference or\r\nbondage (call it which you please) and even for the startling clause of\r\nthe will. At least it would be a face worth seeing: the face of a man\r\nwho was without bowels of mercy: a face which had but to show itself to\r\nraise up, in the mind of the unimpressionable Enfield, a spirit of\r\nenduring hatred.\r\n\r\nFrom that time forward, Mr. Utterson began to haunt the door in the\r\nby-street of shops. In the morning before office hours, at noon when\r\nbusiness was plenty and time scarce, at night under the face of the\r\nfogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or\r\nconcourse, the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post.\r\n\r\n“If he be Mr. Hyde,” he had thought, “I shall be Mr. Seek.”\r\n\r\nAnd at last his patience was rewarded. It was a fine dry night; frost\r\nin the air; the streets as clean as a ballroom floor; the lamps,\r\nunshaken by any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow. By\r\nten o’clock, when the shops were closed, the by-street was very\r\nsolitary and, in spite of the low growl of London from all round, very\r\nsilent. Small sounds carried far; domestic sounds out of the houses\r\nwere clearly audible on either side of the roadway; and the rumour of\r\nthe approach of any passenger preceded him by a long time. Mr. Utterson\r\nhad been some minutes at his post, when he was aware of an odd light\r\nfootstep drawing near. In the course of his nightly patrols, he had\r\nlong grown accustomed to the quaint effect with which the footfalls of\r\na single person, while he is still a great way off, suddenly spring out\r\ndistinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city. Yet his attention\r\nhad never before been so sharply and decisively arrested; and it was\r\nwith a strong, superstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into\r\nthe entry of the court.\r\n\r\nThe steps drew swiftly nearer, and swelled out suddenly louder as they\r\nturned the end of the street. The lawyer, looking forth from the entry,\r\ncould soon see what manner of man he had to deal with. He was small and\r\nvery plainly dressed and the look of him, even at that distance, went\r\nsomehow strongly against the watcher’s inclination. But he made\r\nstraight for the door, crossing the roadway to save time; and as he\r\ncame, he drew a key from his pocket like one approaching home.\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he passed.\r\n“Mr. Hyde, I think?”\r\n\r\nMr. Hyde shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath. But his fear\r\nwas only momentary; and though he did not look the lawyer in the face,\r\nhe answered coolly enough: “That is my name. What do you want?”\r\n\r\n“I see you are going in,” returned the lawyer. “I am an old friend of\r\nDr. Jekyll’s—Mr. Utterson of Gaunt Street—you must have heard of my\r\nname; and meeting you so conveniently, I thought you might admit me.”\r\n\r\n“You will not find Dr. Jekyll; he is from home,” replied Mr. Hyde,\r\nblowing in the key. And then suddenly, but still without looking up,\r\n“How did you know me?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“On your side,” said Mr. Utterson “will you do me a favour?”\r\n\r\n“With pleasure,” replied the other. “What shall it be?”\r\n\r\n“Will you let me see your face?” asked the lawyer.\r\n\r\nMr. Hyde appeared to hesitate, and then, as if upon some sudden\r\nreflection, fronted about with an air of defiance; and the pair stared\r\nat each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds. “Now I shall know you\r\nagain,” said Mr. Utterson. “It may be useful.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” returned Mr. Hyde, “it is as well we have met; and _à propos_,\r\nyou should have my address.” And he gave a number of a street in Soho.\r\n\r\n“Good God!” thought Mr. Utterson, “can he, too, have been thinking of\r\nthe will?” But he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted in\r\nacknowledgment of the address.\r\n\r\n“And now,” said the other, “how did you know me?”\r\n\r\n“By description,” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“Whose description?”\r\n\r\n“We have common friends,” said Mr. Utterson.\r\n\r\n“Common friends,” echoed Mr. Hyde, a little hoarsely. “Who are they?”\r\n\r\n“Jekyll, for instance,” said the lawyer.\r\n\r\n“He never told you,” cried Mr. Hyde, with a flush of anger. “I did not\r\nthink you would have lied.”\r\n\r\n“Come,” said Mr. Utterson, “that is not fitting language.”\r\n\r\nThe other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and the next moment, with\r\nextraordinary quickness, he had unlocked the door and disappeared into\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer stood awhile when Mr. Hyde had left him, the picture of\r\ndisquietude. Then he began slowly to mount the street, pausing every\r\nstep or two and putting his hand to his brow like a man in mental\r\nperplexity. The problem he was thus debating as he walked, was one of a\r\nclass that is rarely solved. Mr. Hyde was pale and dwarfish, he gave an\r\nimpression of deformity without any nameable malformation, he had a\r\ndispleasing smile, he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort of\r\nmurderous mixture of timidity and boldness, and he spoke with a husky,\r\nwhispering and somewhat broken voice; all these were points against\r\nhim, but not all of these together could explain the hitherto unknown\r\ndisgust, loathing and fear with which Mr. Utterson regarded him. “There\r\nmust be something else,” said the perplexed gentleman. “There _is_\r\nsomething more, if I could find a name for it. God bless me, the man\r\nseems hardly human! Something troglodytic, shall we say? or can it be\r\nthe old story of Dr. Fell? or is it the mere radiance of a foul soul\r\nthat thus transpires through, and transfigures, its clay continent? The\r\nlast, I think; for, O my poor old Harry Jekyll, if ever I read Satan’s\r\nsignature upon a face, it is on that of your new friend.”\r\n\r\nRound the corner from the by-street, there was a square of ancient,\r\nhandsome houses, now for the most part decayed from their high estate\r\nand let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of men;\r\nmap-engravers, architects, shady lawyers and the agents of obscure\r\nenterprises. One house, however, second from the corner, was still\r\noccupied entire; and at the door of this, which wore a great air of\r\nwealth and comfort, though it was now plunged in darkness except for\r\nthe fanlight, Mr. Utterson stopped and knocked. A well-dressed, elderly\r\nservant opened the door.\r\n\r\n“Is Dr. Jekyll at home, Poole?” asked the lawyer.\r\n\r\n“I will see, Mr. Utterson,” said Poole, admitting the visitor, as he\r\nspoke, into a large, low-roofed, comfortable hall paved with flags,\r\nwarmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a bright, open fire,\r\nand furnished with costly cabinets of oak. “Will you wait here by the\r\nfire, sir? or shall I give you a light in the dining-room?”\r\n\r\n“Here, thank you,” said the lawyer, and he drew near and leaned on the\r\ntall fender. This hall, in which he was now left alone, was a pet fancy\r\nof his friend the doctor’s; and Utterson himself was wont to speak of\r\nit as the pleasantest room in London. But tonight there was a shudder\r\nin his blood; the face of Hyde sat heavy on his memory; he felt (what\r\nwas rare with him) a nausea and distaste of life; and in the gloom of\r\nhis spirits, he seemed to read a menace in the flickering of the\r\nfirelight on the polished cabinets and the uneasy starting of the\r\nshadow on the roof. He was ashamed of his relief, when Poole presently\r\nreturned to announce that Dr. Jekyll was gone out.\r\n\r\n“I saw Mr. Hyde go in by the old dissecting room, Poole,” he said. “Is\r\nthat right, when Dr. Jekyll is from home?”\r\n\r\n“Quite right, Mr. Utterson, sir,” replied the servant. “Mr. Hyde has a\r\nkey.”\r\n\r\n“Your master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young man,\r\nPoole,” resumed the other musingly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, he does indeed,” said Poole. “We have all orders to obey\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“I do not think I ever met Mr. Hyde?” asked Utterson.\r\n\r\n“O, dear no, sir. He never _dines_ here,” replied the butler. “Indeed\r\nwe see very little of him on this side of the house; he mostly comes\r\nand goes by the laboratory.”\r\n\r\n“Well, good-night, Poole.”\r\n\r\n“Good-night, Mr. Utterson.”\r\n\r\nAnd the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart. “Poor Harry\r\nJekyll,” he thought, “my mind misgives me he is in deep waters! He was\r\nwild when he was young; a long while ago to be sure; but in the law of\r\nGod, there is no statute of limitations. Ay, it must be that; the ghost\r\nof some old sin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace: punishment\r\ncoming, _pede claudo_, years after memory has forgotten and self-love\r\ncondoned the fault.” And the lawyer, scared by the thought, brooded\r\nawhile on his own past, groping in all the corners of memory, lest by\r\nchance some Jack-in-the-Box of an old iniquity should leap to light\r\nthere. His past was fairly blameless; few men could read the rolls of\r\ntheir life with less apprehension; yet he was humbled to the dust by\r\nthe many ill things he had done, and raised up again into a sober and\r\nfearful gratitude by the many he had come so near to doing yet avoided.\r\nAnd then by a return on his former subject, he conceived a spark of\r\nhope. “This Master Hyde, if he were studied,” thought he, “must have\r\nsecrets of his own; black secrets, by the look of him; secrets compared\r\nto which poor Jekyll’s worst would be like sunshine. Things cannot\r\ncontinue as they are. It turns me cold to think of this creature\r\nstealing like a thief to Harry’s bedside; poor Harry, what a wakening!\r\nAnd the danger of it; for if this Hyde suspects the existence of the\r\nwill, he may grow impatient to inherit. Ay, I must put my shoulders to\r\nthe wheel—if Jekyll will but let me,” he added, “if Jekyll will only\r\nlet me.” For once more he saw before his mind’s eye, as clear as\r\ntransparency, the strange clauses of the will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASE\r\n\r\nA fortnight later, by excellent good fortune, the doctor gave one of\r\nhis pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies, all intelligent,\r\nreputable men and all judges of good wine; and Mr. Utterson so\r\ncontrived that he remained behind after the others had departed. This\r\nwas no new arrangement, but a thing that had befallen many scores of\r\ntimes. Where Utterson was liked, he was liked well. Hosts loved to\r\ndetain the dry lawyer, when the light-hearted and loose-tongued had\r\nalready their foot on the threshold; they liked to sit a while in his\r\nunobtrusive company, practising for solitude, sobering their minds in\r\nthe man’s rich silence after the expense and strain of gaiety. To this\r\nrule, Dr. Jekyll was no exception; and as he now sat on the opposite\r\nside of the fire—a large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty, with\r\nsomething of a slyish cast perhaps, but every mark of capacity and\r\nkindness—you could see by his looks that he cherished for Mr. Utterson\r\na sincere and warm affection.\r\n\r\n“I have been wanting to speak to you, Jekyll,” began the latter. “You\r\nknow that will of yours?”\r\n\r\nA close observer might have gathered that the topic was distasteful;\r\nbut the doctor carried it off gaily. “My poor Utterson,” said he, “you\r\nare unfortunate in such a client. I never saw a man so distressed as\r\nyou were by my will; unless it were that hide-bound pedant, Lanyon, at\r\nwhat he called my scientific heresies. O, I know he’s a good fellow—you\r\nneedn’t frown—an excellent fellow, and I always mean to see more of\r\nhim; but a hide-bound pedant for all that; an ignorant, blatant pedant.\r\nI was never more disappointed in any man than Lanyon.”\r\n\r\n“You know I never approved of it,” pursued Utterson, ruthlessly\r\ndisregarding the fresh topic.\r\n\r\n“My will? Yes, certainly, I know that,” said the doctor, a trifle\r\nsharply. “You have told me so.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I tell you so again,” continued the lawyer. “I have been\r\nlearning something of young Hyde.”\r\n\r\nThe large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and\r\nthere came a blackness about his eyes. “I do not care to hear more,”\r\nsaid he. “This is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop.”\r\n\r\n“What I heard was abominable,” said Utterson.\r\n\r\n“It can make no change. You do not understand my position,” returned\r\nthe doctor, with a certain incoherency of manner. “I am painfully\r\nsituated, Utterson; my position is a very strange—a very strange one.\r\nIt is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking.”\r\n\r\n“Jekyll,” said Utterson, “you know me: I am a man to be trusted. Make a\r\nclean breast of this in confidence; and I make no doubt I can get you\r\nout of it.”\r\n\r\n“My good Utterson,” said the doctor, “this is very good of you, this is\r\ndownright good of you, and I cannot find words to thank you in. I\r\nbelieve you fully; I would trust you before any man alive, ay, before\r\nmyself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it isn’t what you fancy;\r\nit is not as bad as that; and just to put your good heart at rest, I\r\nwill tell you one thing: the moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr. Hyde.\r\nI give you my hand upon that; and I thank you again and again; and I\r\nwill just add one little word, Utterson, that I’m sure you’ll take in\r\ngood part: this is a private matter, and I beg of you to let it sleep.”\r\n\r\nUtterson reflected a little, looking in the fire.\r\n\r\n“I have no doubt you are perfectly right,” he said at last, getting to\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\n“Well, but since we have touched upon this business, and for the last\r\ntime I hope,” continued the doctor, “there is one point I should like\r\nyou to understand. I have really a very great interest in poor Hyde. I\r\nknow you have seen him; he told me so; and I fear he was rude. But I do\r\nsincerely take a great, a very great interest in that young man; and if\r\nI am taken away, Utterson, I wish you to promise me that you will bear\r\nwith him and get his rights for him. I think you would, if you knew\r\nall; and it would be a weight off my mind if you would promise.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t pretend that I shall ever like him,” said the lawyer.\r\n\r\n“I don’t ask that,” pleaded Jekyll, laying his hand upon the other’s\r\narm; “I only ask for justice; I only ask you to help him for my sake,\r\nwhen I am no longer here.”\r\n\r\nUtterson heaved an irrepressible sigh. “Well,” said he, “I promise.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAREW MURDER CASE\r\n\r\nNearly a year later, in the month of October, 18—, London was startled\r\nby a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by\r\nthe high position of the victim. The details were few and startling. A\r\nmaid servant living alone in a house not far from the river, had gone\r\nupstairs to bed about eleven. Although a fog rolled over the city in\r\nthe small hours, the early part of the night was cloudless, and the\r\nlane, which the maid’s window overlooked, was brilliantly lit by the\r\nfull moon. It seems she was romantically given, for she sat down upon\r\nher box, which stood immediately under the window, and fell into a\r\ndream of musing. Never (she used to say, with streaming tears, when she\r\nnarrated that experience), never had she felt more at peace with all\r\nmen or thought more kindly of the world. And as she so sat she became\r\naware of an aged beautiful gentleman with white hair, drawing near\r\nalong the lane; and advancing to meet him, another and very small\r\ngentleman, to whom at first she paid less attention. When they had come\r\nwithin speech (which was just under the maid’s eyes) the older man\r\nbowed and accosted the other with a very pretty manner of politeness.\r\nIt did not seem as if the subject of his address were of great\r\nimportance; indeed, from his pointing, it sometimes appeared as if he\r\nwere only inquiring his way; but the moon shone on his face as he\r\nspoke, and the girl was pleased to watch it, it seemed to breathe such\r\nan innocent and old-world kindness of disposition, yet with something\r\nhigh too, as of a well-founded self-content. Presently her eye wandered\r\nto the other, and she was surprised to recognise in him a certain Mr.\r\nHyde, who had once visited her master and for whom she had conceived a\r\ndislike. He had in his hand a heavy cane, with which he was trifling;\r\nbut he answered never a word, and seemed to listen with an\r\nill-contained impatience. And then all of a sudden he broke out in a\r\ngreat flame of anger, stamping with his foot, brandishing the cane, and\r\ncarrying on (as the maid described it) like a madman. The old gentleman\r\ntook a step back, with the air of one very much surprised and a trifle\r\nhurt; and at that Mr. Hyde broke out of all bounds and clubbed him to\r\nthe earth. And next moment, with ape-like fury, he was trampling his\r\nvictim under foot and hailing down a storm of blows, under which the\r\nbones were audibly shattered and the body jumped upon the roadway. At\r\nthe horror of these sights and sounds, the maid fainted.\r\n\r\nIt was two o’clock when she came to herself and called for the police.\r\nThe murderer was gone long ago; but there lay his victim in the middle\r\nof the lane, incredibly mangled. The stick with which the deed had been\r\ndone, although it was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood, had\r\nbroken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty; and\r\none splintered half had rolled in the neighbouring gutter—the other,\r\nwithout doubt, had been carried away by the murderer. A purse and gold\r\nwatch were found upon the victim: but no cards or papers, except a\r\nsealed and stamped envelope, which he had been probably carrying to the\r\npost, and which bore the name and address of Mr. Utterson.\r\n\r\nThis was brought to the lawyer the next morning, before he was out of\r\nbed; and he had no sooner seen it and been told the circumstances, than\r\nhe shot out a solemn lip. “I shall say nothing till I have seen the\r\nbody,” said he; “this may be very serious. Have the kindness to wait\r\nwhile I dress.” And with the same grave countenance he hurried through\r\nhis breakfast and drove to the police station, whither the body had\r\nbeen carried. As soon as he came into the cell, he nodded.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said he, “I recognise him. I am sorry to say that this is Sir\r\nDanvers Carew.”\r\n\r\n“Good God, sir,” exclaimed the officer, “is it possible?” And the next\r\nmoment his eye lighted up with professional ambition. “This will make a\r\ndeal of noise,” he said. “And perhaps you can help us to the man.” And\r\nhe briefly narrated what the maid had seen, and showed the broken\r\nstick.\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson had already quailed at the name of Hyde; but when the\r\nstick was laid before him, he could doubt no longer; broken and\r\nbattered as it was, he recognised it for one that he had himself\r\npresented many years before to Henry Jekyll.\r\n\r\n“Is this Mr. Hyde a person of small stature?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“Particularly small and particularly wicked-looking, is what the maid\r\ncalls him,” said the officer.\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson reflected; and then, raising his head, “If you will come\r\nwith me in my cab,” he said, “I think I can take you to his house.”\r\n\r\nIt was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first fog of the\r\nseason. A great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over heaven, but the\r\nwind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours; so\r\nthat as the cab crawled from street to street, Mr. Utterson beheld a\r\nmarvelous number of degrees and hues of twilight; for here it would be\r\ndark like the back-end of evening; and there would be a glow of a rich,\r\nlurid brown, like the light of some strange conflagration; and here,\r\nfor a moment, the fog would be quite broken up, and a haggard shaft of\r\ndaylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths. The dismal\r\nquarter of Soho seen under these changing glimpses, with its muddy\r\nways, and slatternly passengers, and its lamps, which had never been\r\nextinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful\r\nreinvasion of darkness, seemed, in the lawyer’s eyes, like a district\r\nof some city in a nightmare. The thoughts of his mind, besides, were of\r\nthe gloomiest dye; and when he glanced at the companion of his drive,\r\nhe was conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the law’s\r\nofficers, which may at times assail the most honest.\r\n\r\nAs the cab drew up before the address indicated, the fog lifted a\r\nlittle and showed him a dingy street, a gin palace, a low French eating\r\nhouse, a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads, many\r\nragged children huddled in the doorways, and many women of many\r\ndifferent nationalities passing out, key in hand, to have a morning\r\nglass; and the next moment the fog settled down again upon that part,\r\nas brown as umber, and cut him off from his blackguardly surroundings.\r\nThis was the home of Henry Jekyll’s favourite; of a man who was heir to\r\na quarter of a million sterling.\r\n\r\nAn ivory-faced and silvery-haired old woman opened the door. She had an\r\nevil face, smoothed by hypocrisy: but her manners were excellent. Yes,\r\nshe said, this was Mr. Hyde’s, but he was not at home; he had been in\r\nthat night very late, but he had gone away again in less than an hour;\r\nthere was nothing strange in that; his habits were very irregular, and\r\nhe was often absent; for instance, it was nearly two months since she\r\nhad seen him till yesterday.\r\n\r\n“Very well, then, we wish to see his rooms,” said the lawyer; and when\r\nthe woman began to declare it was impossible, “I had better tell you\r\nwho this person is,” he added. “This is Inspector Newcomen of Scotland\r\nYard.”\r\n\r\nA flash of odious joy appeared upon the woman’s face. “Ah!” said she,\r\n“he is in trouble! What has he done?”\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson and the inspector exchanged glances. “He don’t seem a very\r\npopular character,” observed the latter. “And now, my good woman, just\r\nlet me and this gentleman have a look about us.”\r\n\r\nIn the whole extent of the house, which but for the old woman remained\r\notherwise empty, Mr. Hyde had only used a couple of rooms; but these\r\nwere furnished with luxury and good taste. A closet was filled with\r\nwine; the plate was of silver, the napery elegant; a good picture hung\r\nupon the walls, a gift (as Utterson supposed) from Henry Jekyll, who\r\nwas much of a connoisseur; and the carpets were of many plies and\r\nagreeable in colour. At this moment, however, the rooms bore every mark\r\nof having been recently and hurriedly ransacked; clothes lay about the\r\nfloor, with their pockets inside out; lock-fast drawers stood open; and\r\non the hearth there lay a pile of grey ashes, as though many papers had\r\nbeen burned. From these embers the inspector disinterred the butt end\r\nof a green cheque book, which had resisted the action of the fire; the\r\nother half of the stick was found behind the door; and as this clinched\r\nhis suspicions, the officer declared himself delighted. A visit to the\r\nbank, where several thousand pounds were found to be lying to the\r\nmurderer’s credit, completed his gratification.\r\n\r\n“You may depend upon it, sir,” he told Mr. Utterson: “I have him in my\r\nhand. He must have lost his head, or he never would have left the stick\r\nor, above all, burned the cheque book. Why, money’s life to the man. We\r\nhave nothing to do but wait for him at the bank, and get out the\r\nhandbills.”\r\n\r\nThis last, however, was not so easy of accomplishment; for Mr. Hyde had\r\nnumbered few familiars—even the master of the servant maid had only\r\nseen him twice; his family could nowhere be traced; he had never been\r\nphotographed; and the few who could describe him differed widely, as\r\ncommon observers will. Only on one point were they agreed; and that was\r\nthe haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which the fugitive\r\nimpressed his beholders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCIDENT OF THE LETTER\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon, when Mr. Utterson found his way to Dr.\r\nJekyll’s door, where he was at once admitted by Poole, and carried down\r\nby the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden,\r\nto the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or\r\ndissecting rooms. The doctor had bought the house from the heirs of a\r\ncelebrated surgeon; and his own tastes being rather chemical than\r\nanatomical, had changed the destination of the block at the bottom of\r\nthe garden. It was the first time that the lawyer had been received in\r\nthat part of his friend’s quarters; and he eyed the dingy, windowless\r\nstructure with curiosity, and gazed round with a distasteful sense of\r\nstrangeness as he crossed the theatre, once crowded with eager students\r\nand now lying gaunt and silent, the tables laden with chemical\r\napparatus, the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing\r\nstraw, and the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola. At the\r\nfurther end, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red\r\nbaize; and through this, Mr. Utterson was at last received into the\r\ndoctor’s cabinet. It was a large room fitted round with glass presses,\r\nfurnished, among other things, with a cheval-glass and a business\r\ntable, and looking out upon the court by three dusty windows barred\r\nwith iron. The fire burned in the grate; a lamp was set lighted on the\r\nchimney shelf, for even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly; and\r\nthere, close up to the warmth, sat Dr. Jekyll, looking deathly sick. He\r\ndid not rise to meet his visitor, but held out a cold hand and bade him\r\nwelcome in a changed voice.\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Mr. Utterson, as soon as Poole had left them, “you have\r\nheard the news?”\r\n\r\nThe doctor shuddered. “They were crying it in the square,” he said. “I\r\nheard them in my dining-room.”\r\n\r\n“One word,” said the lawyer. “Carew was my client, but so are you, and\r\nI want to know what I am doing. You have not been mad enough to hide\r\nthis fellow?”\r\n\r\n“Utterson, I swear to God,” cried the doctor, “I swear to God I will\r\nnever set eyes on him again. I bind my honour to you that I am done\r\nwith him in this world. It is all at an end. And indeed he does not\r\nwant my help; you do not know him as I do; he is safe, he is quite\r\nsafe; mark my words, he will never more be heard of.”\r\n\r\nThe lawyer listened gloomily; he did not like his friend’s feverish\r\nmanner. “You seem pretty sure of him,” said he; “and for your sake, I\r\nhope you may be right. If it came to a trial, your name might appear.”\r\n\r\n“I am quite sure of him,” replied Jekyll; “I have grounds for certainty\r\nthat I cannot share with any one. But there is one thing on which you\r\nmay advise me. I have—I have received a letter; and I am at a loss\r\nwhether I should show it to the police. I should like to leave it in\r\nyour hands, Utterson; you would judge wisely, I am sure; I have so\r\ngreat a trust in you.”\r\n\r\n“You fear, I suppose, that it might lead to his detection?” asked the\r\nlawyer.\r\n\r\n“No,” said the other. “I cannot say that I care what becomes of Hyde; I\r\nam quite done with him. I was thinking of my own character, which this\r\nhateful business has rather exposed.”\r\n\r\nUtterson ruminated awhile; he was surprised at his friend’s\r\nselfishness, and yet relieved by it. “Well,” said he, at last, “let me\r\nsee the letter.”\r\n\r\nThe letter was written in an odd, upright hand and signed “Edward\r\nHyde”: and it signified, briefly enough, that the writer’s benefactor,\r\nDr. Jekyll, whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a thousand\r\ngenerosities, need labour under no alarm for his safety, as he had\r\nmeans of escape on which he placed a sure dependence. The lawyer liked\r\nthis letter well enough; it put a better colour on the intimacy than he\r\nhad looked for; and he blamed himself for some of his past suspicions.\r\n\r\n“Have you the envelope?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I burned it,” replied Jekyll, “before I thought what I was about. But\r\nit bore no postmark. The note was handed in.”\r\n\r\n“Shall I keep this and sleep upon it?” asked Utterson.\r\n\r\n“I wish you to judge for me entirely,” was the reply. “I have lost\r\nconfidence in myself.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I shall consider,” returned the lawyer. “And now one word more:\r\nit was Hyde who dictated the terms in your will about that\r\ndisappearance?”\r\n\r\nThe doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness; he shut his mouth\r\ntight and nodded.\r\n\r\n“I knew it,” said Utterson. “He meant to murder you. You had a fine\r\nescape.”\r\n\r\n“I have had what is far more to the purpose,” returned the doctor\r\nsolemnly: “I have had a lesson—O God, Utterson, what a lesson I have\r\nhad!” And he covered his face for a moment with his hands.\r\n\r\nOn his way out, the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with Poole.\r\n“By the bye,” said he, “there was a letter handed in to-day: what was\r\nthe messenger like?” But Poole was positive nothing had come except by\r\npost; “and only circulars by that,” he added.\r\n\r\nThis news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed. Plainly the\r\nletter had come by the laboratory door; possibly, indeed, it had been\r\nwritten in the cabinet; and if that were so, it must be differently\r\njudged, and handled with the more caution. The newsboys, as he went,\r\nwere crying themselves hoarse along the footways: “Special edition.\r\nShocking murder of an M.P.” That was the funeral oration of one friend\r\nand client; and he could not help a certain apprehension lest the good\r\nname of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the scandal. It\r\nwas, at least, a ticklish decision that he had to make; and\r\nself-reliant as he was by habit, he began to cherish a longing for\r\nadvice. It was not to be had directly; but perhaps, he thought, it\r\nmight be fished for.\r\n\r\nPresently after, he sat on one side of his own hearth, with Mr. Guest,\r\nhis head clerk, upon the other, and midway between, at a nicely\r\ncalculated distance from the fire, a bottle of a particular old wine\r\nthat had long dwelt unsunned in the foundations of his house. The fog\r\nstill slept on the wing above the drowned city, where the lamps\r\nglimmered like carbuncles; and through the muffle and smother of these\r\nfallen clouds, the procession of the town’s life was still rolling in\r\nthrough the great arteries with a sound as of a mighty wind. But the\r\nroom was gay with firelight. In the bottle the acids were long ago\r\nresolved; the imperial dye had softened with time, as the colour grows\r\nricher in stained windows; and the glow of hot autumn afternoons on\r\nhillside vineyards, was ready to be set free and to disperse the fogs\r\nof London. Insensibly the lawyer melted. There was no man from whom he\r\nkept fewer secrets than Mr. Guest; and he was not always sure that he\r\nkept as many as he meant. Guest had often been on business to the\r\ndoctor’s; he knew Poole; he could scarce have failed to hear of Mr.\r\nHyde’s familiarity about the house; he might draw conclusions: was it\r\nnot as well, then, that he should see a letter which put that mystery\r\nto right? and above all since Guest, being a great student and critic\r\nof handwriting, would consider the step natural and obliging? The\r\nclerk, besides, was a man of counsel; he could scarce read so strange a\r\ndocument without dropping a remark; and by that remark Mr. Utterson\r\nmight shape his future course.\r\n\r\n“This is a sad business about Sir Danvers,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, indeed. It has elicited a great deal of public feeling,”\r\nreturned Guest. “The man, of course, was mad.”\r\n\r\n“I should like to hear your views on that,” replied Utterson. “I have a\r\ndocument here in his handwriting; it is between ourselves, for I scarce\r\nknow what to do about it; it is an ugly business at the best. But there\r\nit is; quite in your way: a murderer’s autograph.”\r\n\r\nGuest’s eyes brightened, and he sat down at once and studied it with\r\npassion. “No sir,” he said: “not mad; but it is an odd hand.”\r\n\r\n“And by all accounts a very odd writer,” added the lawyer.\r\n\r\nJust then the servant entered with a note.\r\n\r\n“Is that from Dr. Jekyll, sir?” inquired the clerk. “I thought I knew\r\nthe writing. Anything private, Mr. Utterson?”\r\n\r\n“Only an invitation to dinner. Why? Do you want to see it?”\r\n\r\n“One moment. I thank you, sir;” and the clerk laid the two sheets of\r\npaper alongside and sedulously compared their contents. “Thank you,\r\nsir,” he said at last, returning both; “it’s a very interesting\r\nautograph.”\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, during which Mr. Utterson struggled with himself.\r\n“Why did you compare them, Guest?” he inquired suddenly.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” returned the clerk, “there’s a rather singular\r\nresemblance; the two hands are in many points identical: only\r\ndifferently sloped.”\r\n\r\n“Rather quaint,” said Utterson.\r\n\r\n“It is, as you say, rather quaint,” returned Guest.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t speak of this note, you know,” said the master.\r\n\r\n“No, sir,” said the clerk. “I understand.”\r\n\r\nBut no sooner was Mr. Utterson alone that night, than he locked the\r\nnote into his safe, where it reposed from that time forward. “What!” he\r\nthought. “Henry Jekyll forge for a murderer!” And his blood ran cold in\r\nhis veins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCIDENT OF DR. LANYON\r\n\r\nTime ran on; thousands of pounds were offered in reward, for the death\r\nof Sir Danvers was resented as a public injury; but Mr. Hyde had\r\ndisappeared out of the ken of the police as though he had never\r\nexisted. Much of his past was unearthed, indeed, and all disreputable:\r\ntales came out of the man’s cruelty, at once so callous and violent; of\r\nhis vile life, of his strange associates, of the hatred that seemed to\r\nhave surrounded his career; but of his present whereabouts, not a\r\nwhisper. From the time he had left the house in Soho on the morning of\r\nthe murder, he was simply blotted out; and gradually, as time drew on,\r\nMr. Utterson began to recover from the hotness of his alarm, and to\r\ngrow more at quiet with himself. The death of Sir Danvers was, to his\r\nway of thinking, more than paid for by the disappearance of Mr. Hyde.\r\nNow that that evil influence had been withdrawn, a new life began for\r\nDr. Jekyll. He came out of his seclusion, renewed relations with his\r\nfriends, became once more their familiar guest and entertainer; and\r\nwhilst he had always been known for charities, he was now no less\r\ndistinguished for religion. He was busy, he was much in the open air,\r\nhe did good; his face seemed to open and brighten, as if with an inward\r\nconsciousness of service; and for more than two months, the doctor was\r\nat peace.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of January Utterson had dined at the doctor’s with a small\r\nparty; Lanyon had been there; and the face of the host had looked from\r\none to the other as in the old days when the trio were inseparable\r\nfriends. On the 12th, and again on the 14th, the door was shut against\r\nthe lawyer. “The doctor was confined to the house,” Poole said, “and\r\nsaw no one.” On the 15th, he tried again, and was again refused; and\r\nhaving now been used for the last two months to see his friend almost\r\ndaily, he found this return of solitude to weigh upon his spirits. The\r\nfifth night he had in Guest to dine with him; and the sixth he betook\r\nhimself to Dr. Lanyon’s.\r\n\r\nThere at least he was not denied admittance; but when he came in, he\r\nwas shocked at the change which had taken place in the doctor’s\r\nappearance. He had his death-warrant written legibly upon his face. The\r\nrosy man had grown pale; his flesh had fallen away; he was visibly\r\nbalder and older; and yet it was not so much these tokens of a swift\r\nphysical decay that arrested the lawyer’s notice, as a look in the eye\r\nand quality of manner that seemed to testify to some deep-seated terror\r\nof the mind. It was unlikely that the doctor should fear death; and yet\r\nthat was what Utterson was tempted to suspect. “Yes,” he thought; “he\r\nis a doctor, he must know his own state and that his days are counted;\r\nand the knowledge is more than he can bear.” And yet when Utterson\r\nremarked on his ill looks, it was with an air of great firmness that\r\nLanyon declared himself a doomed man.\r\n\r\n“I have had a shock,” he said, “and I shall never recover. It is a\r\nquestion of weeks. Well, life has been pleasant; I liked it; yes, sir,\r\nI used to like it. I sometimes think if we knew all, we should be more\r\nglad to get away.”\r\n\r\n“Jekyll is ill, too,” observed Utterson. “Have you seen him?”\r\n\r\nBut Lanyon’s face changed, and he held up a trembling hand. “I wish to\r\nsee or hear no more of Dr. Jekyll,” he said in a loud, unsteady voice.\r\n“I am quite done with that person; and I beg that you will spare me any\r\nallusion to one whom I regard as dead.”\r\n\r\n“Tut, tut!” said Mr. Utterson; and then after a considerable pause,\r\n“Can’t I do anything?” he inquired. “We are three very old friends,\r\nLanyon; we shall not live to make others.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing can be done,” returned Lanyon; “ask himself.”\r\n\r\n“He will not see me,” said the lawyer.\r\n\r\n“I am not surprised at that,” was the reply. “Some day, Utterson, after\r\nI am dead, you may perhaps come to learn the right and wrong of this. I\r\ncannot tell you. And in the meantime, if you can sit and talk with me\r\nof other things, for God’s sake, stay and do so; but if you cannot keep\r\nclear of this accursed topic, then in God’s name, go, for I cannot bear\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as he got home, Utterson sat down and wrote to Jekyll,\r\ncomplaining of his exclusion from the house, and asking the cause of\r\nthis unhappy break with Lanyon; and the next day brought him a long\r\nanswer, often very pathetically worded, and sometimes darkly mysterious\r\nin drift. The quarrel with Lanyon was incurable. “I do not blame our\r\nold friend,” Jekyll wrote, “but I share his view that we must never\r\nmeet. I mean from henceforth to lead a life of extreme seclusion; you\r\nmust not be surprised, nor must you doubt my friendship, if my door is\r\noften shut even to you. You must suffer me to go my own dark way. I\r\nhave brought on myself a punishment and a danger that I cannot name. If\r\nI am the chief of sinners, I am the chief of sufferers also. I could\r\nnot think that this earth contained a place for sufferings and terrors\r\nso unmanning; and you can do but one thing, Utterson, to lighten this\r\ndestiny, and that is to respect my silence.” Utterson was amazed; the\r\ndark influence of Hyde had been withdrawn, the doctor had returned to\r\nhis old tasks and amities; a week ago, the prospect had smiled with\r\nevery promise of a cheerful and an honoured age; and now in a moment,\r\nfriendship, and peace of mind, and the whole tenor of his life were\r\nwrecked. So great and unprepared a change pointed to madness; but in\r\nview of Lanyon’s manner and words, there must lie for it some deeper\r\nground.\r\n\r\nA week afterwards Dr. Lanyon took to his bed, and in something less\r\nthan a fortnight he was dead. The night after the funeral, at which he\r\nhad been sadly affected, Utterson locked the door of his business room,\r\nand sitting there by the light of a melancholy candle, drew out and set\r\nbefore him an envelope addressed by the hand and sealed with the seal\r\nof his dead friend. “PRIVATE: for the hands of G. J. Utterson ALONE,\r\nand in case of his predecease _to be destroyed unread_,” so it was\r\nemphatically superscribed; and the lawyer dreaded to behold the\r\ncontents. “I have buried one friend to-day,” he thought: “what if this\r\nshould cost me another?” And then he condemned the fear as a\r\ndisloyalty, and broke the seal. Within there was another enclosure,\r\nlikewise sealed, and marked upon the cover as “not to be opened till\r\nthe death or disappearance of Dr. Henry Jekyll.” Utterson could not\r\ntrust his eyes. Yes, it was disappearance; here again, as in the mad\r\nwill which he had long ago restored to its author, here again were the\r\nidea of a disappearance and the name of Henry Jekyll bracketted. But in\r\nthe will, that idea had sprung from the sinister suggestion of the man\r\nHyde; it was set there with a purpose all too plain and horrible.\r\nWritten by the hand of Lanyon, what should it mean? A great curiosity\r\ncame on the trustee, to disregard the prohibition and dive at once to\r\nthe bottom of these mysteries; but professional honour and faith to his\r\ndead friend were stringent obligations; and the packet slept in the\r\ninmost corner of his private safe.\r\n\r\nIt is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer it; and it may\r\nbe doubted if, from that day forth, Utterson desired the society of his\r\nsurviving friend with the same eagerness. He thought of him kindly; but\r\nhis thoughts were disquieted and fearful. He went to call indeed; but\r\nhe was perhaps relieved to be denied admittance; perhaps, in his heart,\r\nhe preferred to speak with Poole upon the doorstep and surrounded by\r\nthe air and sounds of the open city, rather than to be admitted into\r\nthat house of voluntary bondage, and to sit and speak with its\r\ninscrutable recluse. Poole had, indeed, no very pleasant news to\r\ncommunicate. The doctor, it appeared, now more than ever confined\r\nhimself to the cabinet over the laboratory, where he would sometimes\r\neven sleep; he was out of spirits, he had grown very silent, he did not\r\nread; it seemed as if he had something on his mind. Utterson became so\r\nused to the unvarying character of these reports, that he fell off\r\nlittle by little in the frequency of his visits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCIDENT AT THE WINDOW\r\n\r\nIt chanced on Sunday, when Mr. Utterson was on his usual walk with Mr.\r\nEnfield, that their way lay once again through the by-street; and that\r\nwhen they came in front of the door, both stopped to gaze on it.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Enfield, “that story’s at an end at least. We shall never\r\nsee more of Mr. Hyde.”\r\n\r\n“I hope not,” said Utterson. “Did I ever tell you that I once saw him,\r\nand shared your feeling of repulsion?”\r\n\r\n“It was impossible to do the one without the other,” returned Enfield.\r\n“And by the way, what an ass you must have thought me, not to know that\r\nthis was a back way to Dr. Jekyll’s! It was partly your own fault that\r\nI found it out, even when I did.”\r\n\r\n“So you found it out, did you?” said Utterson. “But if that be so, we\r\nmay step into the court and take a look at the windows. To tell you the\r\ntruth, I am uneasy about poor Jekyll; and even outside, I feel as if\r\nthe presence of a friend might do him good.”\r\n\r\nThe court was very cool and a little damp, and full of premature\r\ntwilight, although the sky, high up overhead, was still bright with\r\nsunset. The middle one of the three windows was half-way open; and\r\nsitting close beside it, taking the air with an infinite sadness of\r\nmien, like some disconsolate prisoner, Utterson saw Dr. Jekyll.\r\n\r\n“What! Jekyll!” he cried. “I trust you are better.”\r\n\r\n“I am very low, Utterson,” replied the doctor drearily, “very low. It\r\nwill not last long, thank God.”\r\n\r\n“You stay too much indoors,” said the lawyer. “You should be out,\r\nwhipping up the circulation like Mr. Enfield and me. (This is my\r\ncousin—Mr. Enfield—Dr. Jekyll.) Come now; get your hat and take a quick\r\nturn with us.”\r\n\r\n“You are very good,” sighed the other. “I should like to very much; but\r\nno, no, no, it is quite impossible; I dare not. But indeed, Utterson, I\r\nam very glad to see you; this is really a great pleasure; I would ask\r\nyou and Mr. Enfield up, but the place is really not fit.”\r\n\r\n“Why, then,” said the lawyer, good-naturedly, “the best thing we can do\r\nis to stay down here and speak with you from where we are.”\r\n\r\n“That is just what I was about to venture to propose,” returned the\r\ndoctor with a smile. But the words were hardly uttered, before the\r\nsmile was struck out of his face and succeeded by an expression of such\r\nabject terror and despair, as froze the very blood of the two gentlemen\r\nbelow. They saw it but for a glimpse for the window was instantly\r\nthrust down; but that glimpse had been sufficient, and they turned and\r\nleft the court without a word. In silence, too, they traversed the\r\nby-street; and it was not until they had come into a neighbouring\r\nthoroughfare, where even upon a Sunday there were still some stirrings\r\nof life, that Mr. Utterson at last turned and looked at his companion.\r\nThey were both pale; and there was an answering horror in their eyes.\r\n\r\n“God forgive us, God forgive us,” said Mr. Utterson.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Enfield only nodded his head very seriously, and walked on once\r\nmore in silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAST NIGHT\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson was sitting by his fireside one evening after dinner, when\r\nhe was surprised to receive a visit from Poole.\r\n\r\n“Bless me, Poole, what brings you here?” he cried; and then taking a\r\nsecond look at him, “What ails you?” he added; “is the doctor ill?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Utterson,” said the man, “there is something wrong.”\r\n\r\n“Take a seat, and here is a glass of wine for you,” said the lawyer.\r\n“Now, take your time, and tell me plainly what you want.”\r\n\r\n“You know the doctor’s ways, sir,” replied Poole, “and how he shuts\r\nhimself up. Well, he’s shut up again in the cabinet; and I don’t like\r\nit, sir—I wish I may die if I like it. Mr. Utterson, sir, I’m afraid.”\r\n\r\n“Now, my good man,” said the lawyer, “be explicit. What are you afraid\r\nof?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve been afraid for about a week,” returned Poole, doggedly\r\ndisregarding the question, “and I can bear it no more.”\r\n\r\nThe man’s appearance amply bore out his words; his manner was altered\r\nfor the worse; and except for the moment when he had first announced\r\nhis terror, he had not once looked the lawyer in the face. Even now, he\r\nsat with the glass of wine untasted on his knee, and his eyes directed\r\nto a corner of the floor. “I can bear it no more,” he repeated.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said the lawyer, “I see you have some good reason, Poole; I see\r\nthere is something seriously amiss. Try to tell me what it is.”\r\n\r\n“I think there’s been foul play,” said Poole, hoarsely.\r\n\r\n“Foul play!” cried the lawyer, a good deal frightened and rather\r\ninclined to be irritated in consequence. “What foul play! What does the\r\nman mean?”\r\n\r\n“I daren’t say, sir,” was the answer; “but will you come along with me\r\nand see for yourself?”\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson’s only answer was to rise and get his hat and greatcoat;\r\nbut he observed with wonder the greatness of the relief that appeared\r\nupon the butler’s face, and perhaps with no less, that the wine was\r\nstill untasted when he set it down to follow.\r\n\r\nIt was a wild, cold, seasonable night of March, with a pale moon, lying\r\non her back as though the wind had tilted her, and flying wrack of the\r\nmost diaphanous and lawny texture. The wind made talking difficult, and\r\nflecked the blood into the face. It seemed to have swept the streets\r\nunusually bare of passengers, besides; for Mr. Utterson thought he had\r\nnever seen that part of London so deserted. He could have wished it\r\notherwise; never in his life had he been conscious of so sharp a wish\r\nto see and touch his fellow-creatures; for struggle as he might, there\r\nwas borne in upon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity. The\r\nsquare, when they got there, was full of wind and dust, and the thin\r\ntrees in the garden were lashing themselves along the railing. Poole,\r\nwho had kept all the way a pace or two ahead, now pulled up in the\r\nmiddle of the pavement, and in spite of the biting weather, took off\r\nhis hat and mopped his brow with a red pocket-handkerchief. But for all\r\nthe hurry of his coming, these were not the dews of exertion that he\r\nwiped away, but the moisture of some strangling anguish; for his face\r\nwas white and his voice, when he spoke, harsh and broken.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” he said, “here we are, and God grant there be nothing\r\nwrong.”\r\n\r\n“Amen, Poole,” said the lawyer.\r\n\r\nThereupon the servant knocked in a very guarded manner; the door was\r\nopened on the chain; and a voice asked from within, “Is that you,\r\nPoole?”\r\n\r\n“It’s all right,” said Poole. “Open the door.”\r\n\r\nThe hall, when they entered it, was brightly lighted up; the fire was\r\nbuilt high; and about the hearth the whole of the servants, men and\r\nwomen, stood huddled together like a flock of sheep. At the sight of\r\nMr. Utterson, the housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering; and the\r\ncook, crying out “Bless God! it’s Mr. Utterson,” ran forward as if to\r\ntake him in her arms.\r\n\r\n“What, what? Are you all here?” said the lawyer peevishly. “Very\r\nirregular, very unseemly; your master would be far from pleased.”\r\n\r\n“They’re all afraid,” said Poole.\r\n\r\nBlank silence followed, no one protesting; only the maid lifted her\r\nvoice and now wept loudly.\r\n\r\n“Hold your tongue!” Poole said to her, with a ferocity of accent that\r\ntestified to his own jangled nerves; and indeed, when the girl had so\r\nsuddenly raised the note of her lamentation, they had all started and\r\nturned towards the inner door with faces of dreadful expectation. “And\r\nnow,” continued the butler, addressing the knife-boy, “reach me a\r\ncandle, and we’ll get this through hands at once.” And then he begged\r\nMr. Utterson to follow him, and led the way to the back garden.\r\n\r\n“Now, sir,” said he, “you come as gently as you can. I want you to\r\nhear, and I don’t want you to be heard. And see here, sir, if by any\r\nchance he was to ask you in, don’t go.”\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson’s nerves, at this unlooked-for termination, gave a jerk\r\nthat nearly threw him from his balance; but he recollected his courage\r\nand followed the butler into the laboratory building through the\r\nsurgical theatre, with its lumber of crates and bottles, to the foot of\r\nthe stair. Here Poole motioned him to stand on one side and listen;\r\nwhile he himself, setting down the candle and making a great and\r\nobvious call on his resolution, mounted the steps and knocked with a\r\nsomewhat uncertain hand on the red baize of the cabinet door.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Utterson, sir, asking to see you,” he called; and even as he did\r\nso, once more violently signed to the lawyer to give ear.\r\n\r\nA voice answered from within: “Tell him I cannot see anyone,” it said\r\ncomplainingly.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, sir,” said Poole, with a note of something like triumph in\r\nhis voice; and taking up his candle, he led Mr. Utterson back across\r\nthe yard and into the great kitchen, where the fire was out and the\r\nbeetles were leaping on the floor.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” he said, looking Mr. Utterson in the eyes, “Was that my master’s\r\nvoice?”\r\n\r\n“It seems much changed,” replied the lawyer, very pale, but giving look\r\nfor look.\r\n\r\n“Changed? Well, yes, I think so,” said the butler. “Have I been twenty\r\nyears in this man’s house, to be deceived about his voice? No, sir;\r\nmaster’s made away with; he was made away with eight days ago, when we\r\nheard him cry out upon the name of God; and _who’s_ in there instead of\r\nhim, and _why_ it stays there, is a thing that cries to Heaven, Mr.\r\nUtterson!”\r\n\r\n“This is a very strange tale, Poole; this is rather a wild tale my\r\nman,” said Mr. Utterson, biting his finger. “Suppose it were as you\r\nsuppose, supposing Dr. Jekyll to have been—well, murdered, what could\r\ninduce the murderer to stay? That won’t hold water; it doesn’t commend\r\nitself to reason.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Mr. Utterson, you are a hard man to satisfy, but I’ll do it\r\nyet,” said Poole. “All this last week (you must know) him, or it,\r\nwhatever it is that lives in that cabinet, has been crying night and\r\nday for some sort of medicine and cannot get it to his mind. It was\r\nsometimes his way—the master’s, that is—to write his orders on a sheet\r\nof paper and throw it on the stair. We’ve had nothing else this week\r\nback; nothing but papers, and a closed door, and the very meals left\r\nthere to be smuggled in when nobody was looking. Well, sir, every day,\r\nay, and twice and thrice in the same day, there have been orders and\r\ncomplaints, and I have been sent flying to all the wholesale chemists\r\nin town. Every time I brought the stuff back, there would be another\r\npaper telling me to return it, because it was not pure, and another\r\norder to a different firm. This drug is wanted bitter bad, sir,\r\nwhatever for.”\r\n\r\n“Have you any of these papers?” asked Mr. Utterson.\r\n\r\nPoole felt in his pocket and handed out a crumpled note, which the\r\nlawyer, bending nearer to the candle, carefully examined. Its contents\r\nran thus: “Dr. Jekyll presents his compliments to Messrs. Maw. He\r\nassures them that their last sample is impure and quite useless for his\r\npresent purpose. In the year 18—, Dr. J. purchased a somewhat large\r\nquantity from Messrs. M. He now begs them to search with most sedulous\r\ncare, and should any of the same quality be left, forward it to him at\r\nonce. Expense is no consideration. The importance of this to Dr. J. can\r\nhardly be exaggerated.” So far the letter had run composedly enough,\r\nbut here with a sudden splutter of the pen, the writer’s emotion had\r\nbroken loose. “For God’s sake,” he added, “find me some of the old.”\r\n\r\n“This is a strange note,” said Mr. Utterson; and then sharply, “How do\r\nyou come to have it open?”\r\n\r\n“The man at Maw’s was main angry, sir, and he threw it back to me like\r\nso much dirt,” returned Poole.\r\n\r\n“This is unquestionably the doctor’s hand, do you know?” resumed the\r\nlawyer.\r\n\r\n“I thought it looked like it,” said the servant rather sulkily; and\r\nthen, with another voice, “But what matters hand of write?” he said.\r\n“I’ve seen him!”\r\n\r\n“Seen him?” repeated Mr. Utterson. “Well?”\r\n\r\n“That’s it!” said Poole. “It was this way. I came suddenly into the\r\ntheatre from the garden. It seems he had slipped out to look for this\r\ndrug or whatever it is; for the cabinet door was open, and there he was\r\nat the far end of the room digging among the crates. He looked up when\r\nI came in, gave a kind of cry, and whipped upstairs into the cabinet.\r\nIt was but for one minute that I saw him, but the hair stood upon my\r\nhead like quills. Sir, if that was my master, why had he a mask upon\r\nhis face? If it was my master, why did he cry out like a rat, and run\r\nfrom me? I have served him long enough. And then...” The man paused and\r\npassed his hand over his face.\r\n\r\n“These are all very strange circumstances,” said Mr. Utterson, “but I\r\nthink I begin to see daylight. Your master, Poole, is plainly seized\r\nwith one of those maladies that both torture and deform the sufferer;\r\nhence, for aught I know, the alteration of his voice; hence the mask\r\nand the avoidance of his friends; hence his eagerness to find this\r\ndrug, by means of which the poor soul retains some hope of ultimate\r\nrecovery—God grant that he be not deceived! There is my explanation; it\r\nis sad enough, Poole, ay, and appalling to consider; but it is plain\r\nand natural, hangs well together, and delivers us from all exorbitant\r\nalarms.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said the butler, turning to a sort of mottled pallor, “that\r\nthing was not my master, and there’s the truth. My master”—here he\r\nlooked round him and began to whisper—“is a tall, fine build of a man,\r\nand this was more of a dwarf.” Utterson attempted to protest. “O, sir,”\r\ncried Poole, “do you think I do not know my master after twenty years?\r\nDo you think I do not know where his head comes to in the cabinet door,\r\nwhere I saw him every morning of my life? No, sir, that thing in the\r\nmask was never Dr. Jekyll—God knows what it was, but it was never Dr.\r\nJekyll; and it is the belief of my heart that there was murder done.”\r\n\r\n“Poole,” replied the lawyer, “if you say that, it will become my duty\r\nto make certain. Much as I desire to spare your master’s feelings, much\r\nas I am puzzled by this note which seems to prove him to be still\r\nalive, I shall consider it my duty to break in that door.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, Mr. Utterson, that’s talking!” cried the butler.\r\n\r\n“And now comes the second question,” resumed Utterson: “Who is going to\r\ndo it?”\r\n\r\n“Why, you and me, sir,” was the undaunted reply.\r\n\r\n“That’s very well said,” returned the lawyer; “and whatever comes of\r\nit, I shall make it my business to see you are no loser.”\r\n\r\n“There is an axe in the theatre,” continued Poole; “and you might take\r\nthe kitchen poker for yourself.”\r\n\r\nThe lawyer took that rude but weighty instrument into his hand, and\r\nbalanced it. “Do you know, Poole,” he said, looking up, “that you and I\r\nare about to place ourselves in a position of some peril?”\r\n\r\n“You may say so, sir, indeed,” returned the butler.\r\n\r\n“It is well, then that we should be frank,” said the other. “We both\r\nthink more than we have said; let us make a clean breast. This masked\r\nfigure that you saw, did you recognise it?”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, it went so quick, and the creature was so doubled up, that\r\nI could hardly swear to that,” was the answer. “But if you mean, was it\r\nMr. Hyde?—why, yes, I think it was! You see, it was much of the same\r\nbigness; and it had the same quick, light way with it; and then who\r\nelse could have got in by the laboratory door? You have not forgot,\r\nsir, that at the time of the murder he had still the key with him? But\r\nthat’s not all. I don’t know, Mr. Utterson, if you ever met this Mr.\r\nHyde?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the lawyer, “I once spoke with him.”\r\n\r\n“Then you must know as well as the rest of us that there was something\r\nqueer about that gentleman—something that gave a man a turn—I don’t\r\nknow rightly how to say it, sir, beyond this: that you felt in your\r\nmarrow kind of cold and thin.”\r\n\r\n“I own I felt something of what you describe,” said Mr. Utterson.\r\n\r\n“Quite so, sir,” returned Poole. “Well, when that masked thing like a\r\nmonkey jumped from among the chemicals and whipped into the cabinet, it\r\nwent down my spine like ice. O, I know it’s not evidence, Mr. Utterson;\r\nI’m book-learned enough for that; but a man has his feelings, and I\r\ngive you my bible-word it was Mr. Hyde!”\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay,” said the lawyer. “My fears incline to the same point. Evil, I\r\nfear, founded—evil was sure to come—of that connection. Ay truly, I\r\nbelieve you; I believe poor Harry is killed; and I believe his murderer\r\n(for what purpose, God alone can tell) is still lurking in his victim’s\r\nroom. Well, let our name be vengeance. Call Bradshaw.”\r\n\r\nThe footman came at the summons, very white and nervous.\r\n\r\n“Pull yourself together, Bradshaw,” said the lawyer. “This suspense, I\r\nknow, is telling upon all of you; but it is now our intention to make\r\nan end of it. Poole, here, and I are going to force our way into the\r\ncabinet. If all is well, my shoulders are broad enough to bear the\r\nblame. Meanwhile, lest anything should really be amiss, or any\r\nmalefactor seek to escape by the back, you and the boy must go round\r\nthe corner with a pair of good sticks and take your post at the\r\nlaboratory door. We give you ten minutes to get to your stations.”\r\n\r\nAs Bradshaw left, the lawyer looked at his watch. “And now, Poole, let\r\nus get to ours,” he said; and taking the poker under his arm, led the\r\nway into the yard. The scud had banked over the moon, and it was now\r\nquite dark. The wind, which only broke in puffs and draughts into that\r\ndeep well of building, tossed the light of the candle to and fro about\r\ntheir steps, until they came into the shelter of the theatre, where\r\nthey sat down silently to wait. London hummed solemnly all around; but\r\nnearer at hand, the stillness was only broken by the sounds of a\r\nfootfall moving to and fro along the cabinet floor.\r\n\r\n“So it will walk all day, sir,” whispered Poole; “ay, and the better\r\npart of the night. Only when a new sample comes from the chemist,\r\nthere’s a bit of a break. Ah, it’s an ill conscience that’s such an\r\nenemy to rest! Ah, sir, there’s blood foully shed in every step of it!\r\nBut hark again, a little closer—put your heart in your ears, Mr.\r\nUtterson, and tell me, is that the doctor’s foot?”\r\n\r\nThe steps fell lightly and oddly, with a certain swing, for all they\r\nwent so slowly; it was different indeed from the heavy creaking tread\r\nof Henry Jekyll. Utterson sighed. “Is there never anything else?” he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nPoole nodded. “Once,” he said. “Once I heard it weeping!”\r\n\r\n“Weeping? how that?” said the lawyer, conscious of a sudden chill of\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\n“Weeping like a woman or a lost soul,” said the butler. “I came away\r\nwith that upon my heart, that I could have wept too.”\r\n\r\nBut now the ten minutes drew to an end. Poole disinterred the axe from\r\nunder a stack of packing straw; the candle was set upon the nearest\r\ntable to light them to the attack; and they drew near with bated breath\r\nto where that patient foot was still going up and down, up and down, in\r\nthe quiet of the night.\r\n\r\n“Jekyll,” cried Utterson, with a loud voice, “I demand to see you.” He\r\npaused a moment, but there came no reply. “I give you fair warning, our\r\nsuspicions are aroused, and I must and shall see you,” he resumed; “if\r\nnot by fair means, then by foul—if not of your consent, then by brute\r\nforce!”\r\n\r\n“Utterson,” said the voice, “for God’s sake, have mercy!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, that’s not Jekyll’s voice—it’s Hyde’s!” cried Utterson. “Down with\r\nthe door, Poole!”\r\n\r\nPoole swung the axe over his shoulder; the blow shook the building, and\r\nthe red baize door leaped against the lock and hinges. A dismal\r\nscreech, as of mere animal terror, rang from the cabinet. Up went the\r\naxe again, and again the panels crashed and the frame bounded; four\r\ntimes the blow fell; but the wood was tough and the fittings were of\r\nexcellent workmanship; and it was not until the fifth, that the lock\r\nburst and the wreck of the door fell inwards on the carpet.\r\n\r\nThe besiegers, appalled by their own riot and the stillness that had\r\nsucceeded, stood back a little and peered in. There lay the cabinet\r\nbefore their eyes in the quiet lamplight, a good fire glowing and\r\nchattering on the hearth, the kettle singing its thin strain, a drawer\r\nor two open, papers neatly set forth on the business table, and nearer\r\nthe fire, the things laid out for tea; the quietest room, you would\r\nhave said, and, but for the glazed presses full of chemicals, the most\r\ncommonplace that night in London.\r\n\r\nRight in the middle there lay the body of a man sorely contorted and\r\nstill twitching. They drew near on tiptoe, turned it on its back and\r\nbeheld the face of Edward Hyde. He was dressed in clothes far too large\r\nfor him, clothes of the doctor’s bigness; the cords of his face still\r\nmoved with a semblance of life, but life was quite gone; and by the\r\ncrushed phial in the hand and the strong smell of kernels that hung\r\nupon the air, Utterson knew that he was looking on the body of a\r\nself-destroyer.\r\n\r\n“We have come too late,” he said sternly, “whether to save or punish.\r\nHyde is gone to his account; and it only remains for us to find the\r\nbody of your master.”\r\n\r\nThe far greater proportion of the building was occupied by the theatre,\r\nwhich filled almost the whole ground storey and was lighted from above,\r\nand by the cabinet, which formed an upper storey at one end and looked\r\nupon the court. A corridor joined the theatre to the door on the\r\nby-street; and with this the cabinet communicated separately by a\r\nsecond flight of stairs. There were besides a few dark closets and a\r\nspacious cellar. All these they now thoroughly examined. Each closet\r\nneeded but a glance, for all were empty, and all, by the dust that fell\r\nfrom their doors, had stood long unopened. The cellar, indeed, was\r\nfilled with crazy lumber, mostly dating from the times of the surgeon\r\nwho was Jekyll’s predecessor; but even as they opened the door they\r\nwere advertised of the uselessness of further search, by the fall of a\r\nperfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance.\r\nNowhere was there any trace of Henry Jekyll, dead or alive.\r\n\r\nPoole stamped on the flags of the corridor. “He must be buried here,”\r\nhe said, hearkening to the sound.\r\n\r\n“Or he may have fled,” said Utterson, and he turned to examine the door\r\nin the by-street. It was locked; and lying near by on the flags, they\r\nfound the key, already stained with rust.\r\n\r\n“This does not look like use,” observed the lawyer.\r\n\r\n“Use!” echoed Poole. “Do you not see, sir, it is broken? much as if a\r\nman had stamped on it.”\r\n\r\n“Ay,” continued Utterson, “and the fractures, too, are rusty.” The two\r\nmen looked at each other with a scare. “This is beyond me, Poole,” said\r\nthe lawyer. “Let us go back to the cabinet.”\r\n\r\nThey mounted the stair in silence, and still with an occasional\r\nawestruck glance at the dead body, proceeded more thoroughly to examine\r\nthe contents of the cabinet. At one table, there were traces of\r\nchemical work, various measured heaps of some white salt being laid on\r\nglass saucers, as though for an experiment in which the unhappy man had\r\nbeen prevented.\r\n\r\n“That is the same drug that I was always bringing him,” said Poole; and\r\neven as he spoke, the kettle with a startling noise boiled over.\r\n\r\nThis brought them to the fireside, where the easy-chair was drawn\r\ncosily up, and the tea things stood ready to the sitter’s elbow, the\r\nvery sugar in the cup. There were several books on a shelf; one lay\r\nbeside the tea things open, and Utterson was amazed to find it a copy\r\nof a pious work, for which Jekyll had several times expressed a great\r\nesteem, annotated, in his own hand with startling blasphemies.\r\n\r\nNext, in the course of their review of the chamber, the searchers came\r\nto the cheval-glass, into whose depths they looked with an involuntary\r\nhorror. But it was so turned as to show them nothing but the rosy glow\r\nplaying on the roof, the fire sparkling in a hundred repetitions along\r\nthe glazed front of the presses, and their own pale and fearful\r\ncountenances stooping to look in.\r\n\r\n“This glass has seen some strange things, sir,” whispered Poole.\r\n\r\n“And surely none stranger than itself,” echoed the lawyer in the same\r\ntones. “For what did Jekyll”—he caught himself up at the word with a\r\nstart, and then conquering the weakness—“what could Jekyll want with\r\nit?” he said.\r\n\r\n“You may say that!” said Poole.\r\n\r\nNext they turned to the business table. On the desk, among the neat\r\narray of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the\r\ndoctor’s hand, the name of Mr. Utterson. The lawyer unsealed it, and\r\nseveral enclosures fell to the floor. The first was a will, drawn in\r\nthe same eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six months\r\nbefore, to serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of gift\r\nin case of disappearance; but in place of the name of Edward Hyde, the\r\nlawyer, with indescribable amazement read the name of Gabriel John\r\nUtterson. He looked at Poole, and then back at the paper, and last of\r\nall at the dead malefactor stretched upon the carpet.\r\n\r\n“My head goes round,” he said. “He has been all these days in\r\npossession; he had no cause to like me; he must have raged to see\r\nhimself displaced; and he has not destroyed this document.”\r\n\r\nHe caught up the next paper; it was a brief note in the doctor’s hand\r\nand dated at the top. “O Poole!” the lawyer cried, “he was alive and\r\nhere this day. He cannot have been disposed of in so short a space; he\r\nmust be still alive, he must have fled! And then, why fled? and how?\r\nand in that case, can we venture to declare this suicide? O, we must be\r\ncareful. I foresee that we may yet involve your master in some dire\r\ncatastrophe.”\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you read it, sir?” asked Poole.\r\n\r\n“Because I fear,” replied the lawyer solemnly. “God grant I have no\r\ncause for it!” And with that he brought the paper to his eyes and read\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n“My dear Utterson,—When this shall fall into your hands, I shall have\r\ndisappeared, under what circumstances I have not the penetration to\r\nforesee, but my instinct and all the circumstances of my nameless\r\nsituation tell me that the end is sure and must be early. Go then, and\r\nfirst read the narrative which Lanyon warned me he was to place in your\r\nhands; and if you care to hear more, turn to the confession of\r\n\r\n“Your unworthy and unhappy friend,\r\n\r\n“HENRY JEKYLL.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“There was a third enclosure?” asked Utterson.\r\n\r\n“Here, sir,” said Poole, and gave into his hands a considerable packet\r\nsealed in several places.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer put it in his pocket. “I would say nothing of this paper. If\r\nyour master has fled or is dead, we may at least save his credit. It is\r\nnow ten; I must go home and read these documents in quiet; but I shall\r\nbe back before midnight, when we shall send for the police.”\r\n\r\nThey went out, locking the door of the theatre behind them; and\r\nUtterson, once more leaving the servants gathered about the fire in the\r\nhall, trudged back to his office to read the two narratives in which\r\nthis mystery was now to be explained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. LANYON’S NARRATIVE\r\n\r\nOn the ninth of January, now four days ago, I received by the evening\r\ndelivery a registered envelope, addressed in the hand of my colleague\r\nand old school companion, Henry Jekyll. I was a good deal surprised by\r\nthis; for we were by no means in the habit of correspondence; I had\r\nseen the man, dined with him, indeed, the night before; and I could\r\nimagine nothing in our intercourse that should justify formality of\r\nregistration. The contents increased my wonder; for this is how the\r\nletter ran:\r\n\r\n“10_th December_, 18—.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Dear Lanyon,—You are one of my oldest friends; and although we may\r\nhave differed at times on scientific questions, I cannot remember, at\r\nleast on my side, any break in our affection. There was never a day\r\nwhen, if you had said to me, ‘Jekyll, my life, my honour, my reason,\r\ndepend upon you,’ I would not have sacrificed my left hand to help you.\r\nLanyon, my life, my honour, my reason, are all at your mercy; if you\r\nfail me to-night, I am lost. You might suppose, after this preface,\r\nthat I am going to ask you for something dishonourable to grant. Judge\r\nfor yourself.\r\n\r\n“I want you to postpone all other engagements for to-night—ay, even if\r\nyou were summoned to the bedside of an emperor; to take a cab, unless\r\nyour carriage should be actually at the door; and with this letter in\r\nyour hand for consultation, to drive straight to my house. Poole, my\r\nbutler, has his orders; you will find him waiting your arrival with a\r\nlocksmith. The door of my cabinet is then to be forced; and you are to\r\ngo in alone; to open the glazed press (letter E) on the left hand,\r\nbreaking the lock if it be shut; and to draw out, _with all its\r\ncontents as they stand_, the fourth drawer from the top or (which is\r\nthe same thing) the third from the bottom. In my extreme distress of\r\nmind, I have a morbid fear of misdirecting you; but even if I am in\r\nerror, you may know the right drawer by its contents: some powders, a\r\nphial and a paper book. This drawer I beg of you to carry back with you\r\nto Cavendish Square exactly as it stands.\r\n\r\n“That is the first part of the service: now for the second. You should\r\nbe back, if you set out at once on the receipt of this, long before\r\nmidnight; but I will leave you that amount of margin, not only in the\r\nfear of one of those obstacles that can neither be prevented nor\r\nforeseen, but because an hour when your servants are in bed is to be\r\npreferred for what will then remain to do. At midnight, then, I have to\r\nask you to be alone in your consulting room, to admit with your own\r\nhand into the house a man who will present himself in my name, and to\r\nplace in his hands the drawer that you will have brought with you from\r\nmy cabinet. Then you will have played your part and earned my gratitude\r\ncompletely. Five minutes afterwards, if you insist upon an explanation,\r\nyou will have understood that these arrangements are of capital\r\nimportance; and that by the neglect of one of them, fantastic as they\r\nmust appear, you might have charged your conscience with my death or\r\nthe shipwreck of my reason.\r\n\r\n“Confident as I am that you will not trifle with this appeal, my heart\r\nsinks and my hand trembles at the bare thought of such a possibility.\r\nThink of me at this hour, in a strange place, labouring under a\r\nblackness of distress that no fancy can exaggerate, and yet well aware\r\nthat, if you will but punctually serve me, my troubles will roll away\r\nlike a story that is told. Serve me, my dear Lanyon and save\r\n\r\n“Your friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n“H.J.\r\n\r\n\r\n“P.S.—I had already sealed this up when a fresh terror struck upon my\r\nsoul. It is possible that the post-office may fail me, and this letter\r\nnot come into your hands until to-morrow morning. In that case, dear\r\nLanyon, do my errand when it shall be most convenient for you in the\r\ncourse of the day; and once more expect my messenger at midnight. It\r\nmay then already be too late; and if that night passes without event,\r\nyou will know that you have seen the last of Henry Jekyll.”\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon the reading of this letter, I made sure my colleague was insane;\r\nbut till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubt, I felt bound\r\nto do as he requested. The less I understood of this farrago, the less\r\nI was in a position to judge of its importance; and an appeal so worded\r\ncould not be set aside without a grave responsibility. I rose\r\naccordingly from table, got into a hansom, and drove straight to\r\nJekyll’s house. The butler was awaiting my arrival; he had received by\r\nthe same post as mine a registered letter of instruction, and had sent\r\nat once for a locksmith and a carpenter. The tradesmen came while we\r\nwere yet speaking; and we moved in a body to old Dr. Denman’s surgical\r\ntheatre, from which (as you are doubtless aware) Jekyll’s private\r\ncabinet is most conveniently entered. The door was very strong, the\r\nlock excellent; the carpenter avowed he would have great trouble and\r\nhave to do much damage, if force were to be used; and the locksmith was\r\nnear despair. But this last was a handy fellow, and after two hour’s\r\nwork, the door stood open. The press marked E was unlocked; and I took\r\nout the drawer, had it filled up with straw and tied in a sheet, and\r\nreturned with it to Cavendish Square.\r\n\r\nHere I proceeded to examine its contents. The powders were neatly\r\nenough made up, but not with the nicety of the dispensing chemist; so\r\nthat it was plain they were of Jekyll’s private manufacture; and when I\r\nopened one of the wrappers I found what seemed to me a simple\r\ncrystalline salt of a white colour. The phial, to which I next turned\r\nmy attention, might have been about half full of a blood-red liquor,\r\nwhich was highly pungent to the sense of smell and seemed to me to\r\ncontain phosphorus and some volatile ether. At the other ingredients I\r\ncould make no guess. The book was an ordinary version book and\r\ncontained little but a series of dates. These covered a period of many\r\nyears, but I observed that the entries ceased nearly a year ago and\r\nquite abruptly. Here and there a brief remark was appended to a date,\r\nusually no more than a single word: “double” occurring perhaps six\r\ntimes in a total of several hundred entries; and once very early in the\r\nlist and followed by several marks of exclamation, “total failure!!!”\r\nAll this, though it whetted my curiosity, told me little that was\r\ndefinite. Here were a phial of some salt, and the record of a series of\r\nexperiments that had led (like too many of Jekyll’s investigations) to\r\nno end of practical usefulness. How could the presence of these\r\narticles in my house affect either the honour, the sanity, or the life\r\nof my flighty colleague? If his messenger could go to one place, why\r\ncould he not go to another? And even granting some impediment, why was\r\nthis gentleman to be received by me in secret? The more I reflected the\r\nmore convinced I grew that I was dealing with a case of cerebral\r\ndisease; and though I dismissed my servants to bed, I loaded an old\r\nrevolver, that I might be found in some posture of self-defence.\r\n\r\nTwelve o’clock had scarce rung out over London, ere the knocker sounded\r\nvery gently on the door. I went myself at the summons, and found a\r\nsmall man crouching against the pillars of the portico.\r\n\r\n“Are you come from Dr. Jekyll?” I asked.\r\n\r\nHe told me “yes” by a constrained gesture; and when I had bidden him\r\nenter, he did not obey me without a searching backward glance into the\r\ndarkness of the square. There was a policeman not far off, advancing\r\nwith his bull’s eye open; and at the sight, I thought my visitor\r\nstarted and made greater haste.\r\n\r\nThese particulars struck me, I confess, disagreeably; and as I followed\r\nhim into the bright light of the consulting room, I kept my hand ready\r\non my weapon. Here, at last, I had a chance of clearly seeing him. I\r\nhad never set eyes on him before, so much was certain. He was small, as\r\nI have said; I was struck besides with the shocking expression of his\r\nface, with his remarkable combination of great muscular activity and\r\ngreat apparent debility of constitution, and—last but not least—with\r\nthe odd, subjective disturbance caused by his neighbourhood. This bore\r\nsome resemblance to incipient rigour, and was accompanied by a marked\r\nsinking of the pulse. At the time, I set it down to some idiosyncratic,\r\npersonal distaste, and merely wondered at the acuteness of the\r\nsymptoms; but I have since had reason to believe the cause to lie much\r\ndeeper in the nature of man, and to turn on some nobler hinge than the\r\nprinciple of hatred.\r\n\r\nThis person (who had thus, from the first moment of his entrance,\r\nstruck in me what I can only describe as a disgustful curiosity) was\r\ndressed in a fashion that would have made an ordinary person laughable;\r\nhis clothes, that is to say, although they were of rich and sober\r\nfabric, were enormously too large for him in every measurement—the\r\ntrousers hanging on his legs and rolled up to keep them from the\r\nground, the waist of the coat below his haunches, and the collar\r\nsprawling wide upon his shoulders. Strange to relate, this ludicrous\r\naccoutrement was far from moving me to laughter. Rather, as there was\r\nsomething abnormal and misbegotten in the very essence of the creature\r\nthat now faced me—something seizing, surprising and revolting—this\r\nfresh disparity seemed but to fit in with and to reinforce it; so that\r\nto my interest in the man’s nature and character, there was added a\r\ncuriosity as to his origin, his life, his fortune and status in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThese observations, though they have taken so great a space to be set\r\ndown in, were yet the work of a few seconds. My visitor was, indeed, on\r\nfire with sombre excitement.\r\n\r\n“Have you got it?” he cried. “Have you got it?” And so lively was his\r\nimpatience that he even laid his hand upon my arm and sought to shake\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI put him back, conscious at his touch of a certain icy pang along my\r\nblood. “Come, sir,” said I. “You forget that I have not yet the\r\npleasure of your acquaintance. Be seated, if you please.” And I showed\r\nhim an example, and sat down myself in my customary seat and with as\r\nfair an imitation of my ordinary manner to a patient, as the lateness\r\nof the hour, the nature of my preoccupations, and the horror I had of\r\nmy visitor, would suffer me to muster.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon, Dr. Lanyon,” he replied civilly enough. “What you\r\nsay is very well founded; and my impatience has shown its heels to my\r\npoliteness. I come here at the instance of your colleague, Dr. Henry\r\nJekyll, on a piece of business of some moment; and I understood...” He\r\npaused and put his hand to his throat, and I could see, in spite of his\r\ncollected manner, that he was wrestling against the approaches of the\r\nhysteria—“I understood, a drawer...”\r\n\r\nBut here I took pity on my visitor’s suspense, and some perhaps on my\r\nown growing curiosity.\r\n\r\n“There it is, sir,” said I, pointing to the drawer, where it lay on the\r\nfloor behind a table and still covered with the sheet.\r\n\r\nHe sprang to it, and then paused, and laid his hand upon his heart; I\r\ncould hear his teeth grate with the convulsive action of his jaws; and\r\nhis face was so ghastly to see that I grew alarmed both for his life\r\nand reason.\r\n\r\n“Compose yourself,” said I.\r\n\r\nHe turned a dreadful smile to me, and as if with the decision of\r\ndespair, pluck"

Alice’s Evidence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nDown the Rabbit-Hole\r\n\r\n\r\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\r\nbank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\r\nthe book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\r\nconversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice\r\n“without pictures or conversations?”\r\n\r\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\r\nhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\r\nmaking a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\r\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\r\nclose by her.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\r\nso _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh\r\ndear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,\r\nit occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\r\ntime it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\r\nwatch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\r\non, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\r\nhad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\r\nwatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\r\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\r\nlarge rabbit-hole under the hedge.\r\n\r\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\r\nin the world she was to get out again.\r\n\r\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\r\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\r\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\r\ndeep well.\r\n\r\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\r\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\r\nwas going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\r\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\r\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\r\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\r\nhung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\r\npassed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great\r\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\r\nof killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\r\ncupboards as she fell past it.\r\n\r\n“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall\r\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me\r\nat home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the\r\ntop of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)\r\n\r\nDown, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? “I wonder how\r\nmany miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be\r\ngetting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\r\nbe four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt\r\nseveral things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\r\nthough this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\r\nknowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\r\npractice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but\r\nthen I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no\r\nidea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\r\ngrand words to say.)\r\n\r\nPresently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right _through_\r\nthe earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk\r\nwith their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather\r\nglad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all\r\nthe right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\r\ncountry is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?”\r\n(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you’re\r\nfalling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what\r\nan ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do\r\nto ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”\r\n\r\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\r\ntalking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!”\r\n(Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at\r\ntea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\r\nno mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s\r\nvery like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here\r\nAlice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\r\ndreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and\r\nsometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer\r\neither question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt\r\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\r\nwalking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\r\n“Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly,\r\nthump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\r\nthe fall was over.\r\n\r\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\r\nshe looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\r\nlong passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down\r\nit. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\r\nand was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears\r\nand whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she\r\nturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\r\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\r\nfrom the roof.\r\n\r\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\r\nAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\r\ndoor, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\r\nget out again.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\r\nglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s\r\nfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\r\nbut, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\r\nbut at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\r\ntime round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\r\nbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\r\nlittle golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\r\n\r\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\r\nmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\r\npassage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get\r\nout of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\r\nflowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\r\nthrough the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought\r\npoor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,\r\nhow I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only\r\nknew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\r\nhappened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things\r\nindeed were really impossible.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\r\nback to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\r\nany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\r\ntime she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here\r\nbefore,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\r\nlabel, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nIt was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was\r\nnot going to do _that_ in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said,\r\n“and see whether it’s marked ‘_poison_’ or not”; for she had read\r\nseveral nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and\r\neaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they\r\n_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:\r\nsuch as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;\r\nand that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually\r\nbleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a\r\nbottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you,\r\nsooner or later.\r\n\r\nHowever, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to\r\ntaste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed\r\nflavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and\r\nhot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\r\n\r\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a\r\ntelescope.”\r\n\r\nAnd so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\r\nbrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\r\nthrough the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she\r\nwaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\r\nshe felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,”\r\nsaid Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I\r\nwonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the\r\nflame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could\r\nnot remember ever having seen such a thing.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\r\ninto the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the\r\ndoor, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\r\nwent back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\r\nit: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\r\nbest to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\r\nand when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\r\nsat down and cried.\r\n\r\n“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself,\r\nrather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally\r\ngave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\r\nand sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\r\nher eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\r\ncheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\r\nfor this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.\r\n“But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two\r\npeople! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable\r\nperson!”\r\n\r\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\r\nshe opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\r\n“EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said\r\nAlice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\r\nmakes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll\r\nget into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”\r\n\r\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which\r\nway?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\r\ngrowing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\r\nsize: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\r\nhad got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\r\nthings to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go\r\non in the common way.\r\n\r\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\r\n\r\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nThe Pool of Tears\r\n\r\n\r\n“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\r\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m\r\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!”\r\n(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\r\nsight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet, I\r\nwonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m\r\nsure _I_ shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\r\nmyself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be\r\nkind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I\r\nwant to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every\r\nChristmas.”\r\n\r\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They must\r\ngo by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending\r\npresents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!\r\n\r\n     _Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with\r\n     Alice’s love_).\r\n\r\nOh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”\r\n\r\nJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was\r\nnow more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden\r\nkey and hurried off to the garden door.\r\n\r\nPoor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\r\nlook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\r\nhopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.\r\n\r\n“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like\r\nyou,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop\r\nthis moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding\r\ngallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about\r\nfour inches deep and reaching half down the hall.\r\n\r\nAfter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and\r\nshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White\r\nRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves\r\nin one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a\r\ngreat hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the\r\nDuchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt\r\nso desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the\r\nRabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please,\r\nsir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and\r\nthe fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\r\n\r\nAlice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\r\nkept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear! How\r\nqueer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.\r\nI wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the\r\nsame when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling\r\na little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who\r\nin the world am I? Ah, _that’s_ the great puzzle!” And she began\r\nthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as\r\nherself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.\r\n\r\n“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long\r\nringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t\r\nbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a\r\nvery little! Besides, _she’s_ she, and _I’m_ I, and—oh dear, how\r\npuzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know.\r\nLet me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,\r\nand four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that\r\nrate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try\r\nGeography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of\r\nRome, and Rome—no, _that’s_ all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been\r\nchanged for Mabel! I’ll try and say ‘_How doth the little_—’” and she\r\ncrossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began\r\nto repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words\r\ndid not come the same as they used to do:—\r\n\r\n“How doth the little crocodile\r\n    Improve his shining tail,\r\nAnd pour the waters of the Nile\r\n    On every golden scale!\r\n\r\n“How cheerfully he seems to grin,\r\n    How neatly spread his claws,\r\nAnd welcome little fishes in\r\n    With gently smiling jaws!”\r\n\r\n\r\n“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes\r\nfilled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and\r\nI shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to\r\nno toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve\r\nmade up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be\r\nno use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear!’\r\nI shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then? Tell me that first, and\r\nthen, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down\r\nhere till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, with a sudden\r\nburst of tears, “I do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so\r\n_very_ tired of being all alone here!”\r\n\r\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\r\nthat she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while\r\nshe was talking. “How _can_ I have done that?” she thought. “I must be\r\ngrowing small again.” She got up and went to the table to measure\r\nherself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was\r\nnow about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon\r\nfound out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she\r\ndropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\r\n\r\n“That _was_ a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\r\nsudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; “and\r\nnow for the garden!” and she ran with all speed back to the little\r\ndoor: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden\r\nkey was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than\r\never,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this\r\nbefore, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”\r\n\r\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,\r\nsplash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that\r\nshe had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by\r\nrailway,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\r\nher life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\r\nto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\r\nsea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\r\nof lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she\r\nsoon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\r\nshe was nine feet high.\r\n\r\n“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying\r\nto find her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\r\nbeing drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be\r\nsure! However, everything is queer to-day.”\r\n\r\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\r\noff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\r\nit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\r\nshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\r\nslipped in like herself.\r\n\r\n“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?\r\nEverything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\r\nlikely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she\r\nbegan: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\r\nof swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right\r\nway of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\r\nshe remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of\r\na mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather\r\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\r\nbut it said nothing.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s\r\na French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all\r\nher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\r\nanything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which\r\nwas the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\r\nsudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\r\nfright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she\r\nhad hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot you didn’t like\r\ncats.”\r\n\r\n“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would\r\n_you_ like cats if you were me?”\r\n\r\n“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry\r\nabout it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d\r\ntake a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear\r\nquiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\r\nin the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\r\npaws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to\r\nnurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your\r\npardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\r\nover, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “We won’t talk\r\nabout her any more if you’d rather not.”\r\n\r\n“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\r\ntail. “As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always\r\n_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name\r\nagain!”\r\n\r\n“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\r\nconversation. “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not\r\nanswer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near\r\nour house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you\r\nknow, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when\r\nyou throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\r\nof things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you\r\nknow, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says\r\nit kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,\r\n“I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming away\r\nfrom her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the\r\npool as it went.\r\n\r\nSo she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\r\nwon’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the\r\nMouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face\r\nwas quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\r\ntrembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my\r\nhistory, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”\r\n\r\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\r\nbirds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a\r\nDodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice\r\nled the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nA Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the\r\nbirds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\r\nto them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nThe first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\r\nconsultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite\r\nnatural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if\r\nshe had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument\r\nwith the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am\r\nolder than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow\r\nwithout knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to\r\ntell its age, there was no more to be said.\r\n\r\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\r\ncalled out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I’ll_ soon make\r\nyou dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the\r\nMouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she\r\nfelt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\r\n\r\n“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This\r\nis the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ‘William\r\nthe Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted\r\nto by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much\r\naccustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of\r\nMercia and Northumbria—’”\r\n\r\n“Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: “Did\r\nyou speak?”\r\n\r\n“Not I!” said the Lory hastily.\r\n\r\n“I thought you did,” said the Mouse. “—I proceed. ‘Edwin and Morcar,\r\nthe earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even\r\nStigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—’”\r\n\r\n“Found _what_?” said the Duck.\r\n\r\n“Found _it_,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course you know\r\nwhat ‘it’ means.”\r\n\r\n“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,” said the\r\nDuck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the\r\narchbishop find?”\r\n\r\nThe Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found\r\nit advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him\r\nthe crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence\r\nof his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?” it continued,\r\nturning to Alice as it spoke.\r\n\r\n“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to\r\ndry me at all.”\r\n\r\n“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, “I move\r\nthat the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic\r\nremedies—”\r\n\r\n“Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning of half\r\nthose long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!” And\r\nthe Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds\r\ntittered audibly.\r\n\r\n“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was,\r\nthat the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”\r\n\r\n“What _is_ a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she wanted much to\r\nknow, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to\r\nspeak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\r\n\r\n“Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.” (And,\r\nas you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will\r\ntell you how the Dodo managed it.)\r\n\r\nFirst it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact\r\nshape doesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed\r\nalong the course, here and there. There was no “One, two, three, and\r\naway,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\r\nliked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\r\nwhen they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry\r\nagain, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all\r\ncrowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has won?”\r\n\r\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\r\nthought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its\r\nforehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the\r\npictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo\r\nsaid, “_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.”\r\n\r\n“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.\r\n\r\n“Why, _she_, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one\r\nfinger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a\r\nconfused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”\r\n\r\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\r\npocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had\r\nnot got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly\r\none a-piece, all round.\r\n\r\n“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the Mouse.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely. “What else have you got in\r\nyour pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice.\r\n\r\n“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.\r\n\r\n“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.\r\n\r\nThen they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly\r\npresented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant\r\nthimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech, they all\r\ncheered.\r\n\r\nAlice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave\r\nthat she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything\r\nto say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as\r\nshe could.\r\n\r\nThe next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\r\nconfusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\r\ntheirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.\r\nHowever, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\r\nbegged the Mouse to tell them something more.\r\n\r\n“You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why\r\nit is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it\r\nwould be offended again.\r\n\r\n“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and\r\nsighing.\r\n\r\n“It _is_ a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder\r\nat the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on\r\npuzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the\r\ntale was something like this:—\r\n\r\n         “Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, ‘Let us both\r\n         go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.—Come, I’ll take no\r\n         denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I’ve\r\n         nothing to do.’ Said the mouse to the cur, ‘Such a trial, dear\r\n         sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.’\r\n         ‘I’ll be judge, I’ll be jury,’ Said cunning old Fury: ‘I’ll\r\n         try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.’”\r\n\r\n“You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice severely. “What are\r\nyou thinking of?”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the fifth\r\nbend, I think?”\r\n\r\n“I had _not!_” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.\r\n\r\n“A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking\r\nanxiously about her. “Oh, do let me help to undo it!”\r\n\r\n“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and\r\nwalking away. “You insult me by talking such nonsense!”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice. “But you’re so easily offended,\r\nyou know!”\r\n\r\nThe Mouse only growled in reply.\r\n\r\n“Please come back and finish your story!” Alice called after it; and\r\nthe others all joined in chorus, “Yes, please do!” but the Mouse only\r\nshook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.\r\n\r\n“What a pity it wouldn’t stay!” sighed the Lory, as soon as it was\r\nquite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to\r\nher daughter “Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose\r\n_your_ temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said the young Crab, a little\r\nsnappishly. “You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!”\r\n\r\n“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud,\r\naddressing nobody in particular. “She’d soon fetch it back!”\r\n\r\n“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?” said the\r\nLory.\r\n\r\nAlice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:\r\n“Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you\r\ncan’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,\r\nshe’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!”\r\n\r\nThis speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the\r\nbirds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very\r\ncarefully, remarking, “I really must be getting home; the night-air\r\ndoesn’t suit my throat!” and a Canary called out in a trembling voice\r\nto its children, “Come away, my dears! It’s high time you were all in\r\nbed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n“I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a melancholy\r\ntone. “Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best\r\ncat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you\r\nany more!” And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very\r\nlonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a\r\nlittle pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up\r\neagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was\r\ncoming back to finish his story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nThe Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\r\nanxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard\r\nit muttering to itself “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh\r\nmy fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\r\nferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a\r\nmoment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid\r\ngloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but\r\nthey were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since\r\nher swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the\r\nlittle door, had vanished completely.\r\n\r\nVery soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\r\ncalled out to her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you\r\ndoing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and\r\na fan! Quick, now!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off\r\nat once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the\r\nmistake it had made.\r\n\r\n“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How\r\nsurprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him\r\nhis fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this, she\r\ncame upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\r\nplate with the name “W. RABBIT,” engraved upon it. She went in without\r\nknocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\r\nreal Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\r\nfan and gloves.\r\n\r\n“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for\r\na rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!” And she\r\nbegan fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come\r\nhere directly, and get ready for your walk!’ ‘Coming in a minute,\r\nnurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I\r\ndon’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house\r\nif it began ordering people about like that!”\r\n\r\nBy this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\r\nin the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three\r\npairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the\r\ngloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\r\nlittle bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label\r\nthis time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it\r\nand put it to her lips. “I know _something_ interesting is sure to\r\nhappen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so\r\nI’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large\r\nagain, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”\r\n\r\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\r\ndrunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\r\nand had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\r\ndown the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t\r\ngrow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t\r\ndrunk quite so much!”\r\n\r\nAlas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\r\nand very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\r\nwas not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\r\none elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\r\nStill she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\r\nof the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I\r\ncan do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?”\r\n\r\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\r\nand she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\r\nseemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\r\nagain, no wonder she felt unhappy.\r\n\r\n“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t\r\nalways growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\r\nrabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and\r\nyet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\r\n_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied\r\nthat kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of\r\none! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And\r\nwhen I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,” she added in a\r\nsorrowful tone; “at least there’s no room to grow up any more _here_.”\r\n\r\n“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I _never_ get any older than I am\r\nnow? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but\r\nthen—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like _that!_”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you learn\r\nlessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all\r\nfor any lesson-books!”\r\n\r\nAnd so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and\r\nmaking quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes\r\nshe heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\r\n\r\n“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this moment!”\r\nThen came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\r\nthe Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\r\nhouse, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as\r\nlarge as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\r\n\r\nPresently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\r\nthe door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it,\r\nthat attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll\r\ngo round and get in at the window.”\r\n\r\n“_That_ you won’t!” thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\r\nshe heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\r\nhand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\r\nbut she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\r\nfrom which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\r\ncucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\r\n\r\nNext came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Where are you?” And\r\nthen a voice she had never heard before, “Sure then I’m here! Digging\r\nfor apples, yer honour!”\r\n\r\n“Digging for apples, indeed!” said the Rabbit angrily. “Here! Come and\r\nhelp me out of _this!_” (Sounds of more broken glass.)\r\n\r\n“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”\r\n\r\n“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)\r\n\r\n“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole\r\nwindow!”\r\n\r\n“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\r\nnow and then; such as, “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at\r\nall!” “Do as I tell you, you coward!” and at last she spread out her\r\nhand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\r\n_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. “What a number\r\nof cucumber-frames there must be!” thought Alice. “I wonder what\r\nthey’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they\r\n_could!_ I’m sure _I_ don’t want to stay in here any longer!”\r\n\r\nShe waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\r\nrumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all\r\ntalking together: she made out the words: “Where’s the other\r\nladder?—Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill!\r\nfetch it here, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em\r\ntogether first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh! they’ll do\r\nwell enough; don’t be particular—Here, Bill! catch hold of this\r\nrope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming down!\r\nHeads below!” (a loud crash)—“Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I\r\nfancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, _I_ shan’t! _You_ do\r\nit!—_That_ I won’t, then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill! the master says\r\nyou’re to go down the chimney!”\r\n\r\n“Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said Alice to\r\nherself. “Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in\r\nBill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\r\nI _think_ I can kick a little!”\r\n\r\nShe drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till\r\nshe heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was)\r\nscratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\r\nsaying to herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited\r\nto see what would happen next.\r\n\r\nThe first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!”\r\nthen the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge!” then\r\nsilence, and then another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy\r\nnow—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell\r\nus all about it!”\r\n\r\nLast came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’s Bill,” thought\r\nAlice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m\r\na deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me\r\nlike a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”\r\n\r\n“So you did, old fellow!” said the others.\r\n\r\n“We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice\r\ncalled out as loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!”\r\n\r\nThere was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I\r\nwonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the\r\nroof off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\r\nAlice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”\r\n\r\n“A barrowful of _what?_” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\r\nfor the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\r\nwindow, and some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop to\r\nthis,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that\r\nagain!” which produced another dead silence.\r\n\r\nAlice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\r\nlittle cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\r\nhead. “If I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make\r\n_some_ change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it\r\nmust make me smaller, I suppose.”\r\n\r\nSo she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\r\nbegan shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get\r\nthrough the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of\r\nlittle animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,\r\nwas in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\r\nsomething out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\r\nappeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\r\nsafe in a thick wood.\r\n\r\n“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she\r\nwandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the\r\nsecond thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that\r\nwill be the best plan.”\r\n\r\nIt sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\r\narranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\r\nhow to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\r\nthe trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\r\ngreat hurry.\r\n\r\nAn enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\r\nfeebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “Poor little\r\nthing!” said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to\r\nit; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it\r\nmight be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in\r\nspite of all her coaxing.\r\n\r\nHardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\r\nheld it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\r\nall its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\r\nand made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\r\nto keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\r\nother side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\r\nover heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\r\nvery like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\r\nmoment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\r\nthe puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\r\nlittle way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\r\nall the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\r\nits tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\r\nset off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,\r\nand till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\r\n\r\n“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant\r\nagainst a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\r\nleaves: “I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d\r\nonly been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that\r\nI’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how _is_ it to be managed? I\r\nsuppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great\r\nquestion is, what?”\r\n\r\nThe great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at\r\nthe flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\r\nlooked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\r\nThere was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\r\nherself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\r\nbehind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\r\nwas on the top of it.\r\n\r\nShe stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\r\nmushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue\r\ncaterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly\r\nsmoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of\r\nanything else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nAdvice from a Caterpillar\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in\r\nsilence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\r\naddressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\r\n\r\n“Who are _you?_” said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\nThis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\r\nrather shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know\r\nwho I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\r\nchanged several times since then.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly. “Explain\r\nyourself!”\r\n\r\n“I can’t explain _myself_, I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m\r\nnot myself, you see.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied very politely,\r\n“for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\r\ndifferent sizes in a day is very confusing.”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n“Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when you\r\nhave to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then\r\nafter that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little\r\nqueer, won’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice; “all I know\r\nis, it would feel very queer to _me_.”\r\n\r\n“You!” said the Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who are _you?_”\r\n\r\nWhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\r\nAlice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such _very_\r\nshort remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, “I\r\nthink, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\nHere was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\r\ngood reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant\r\nstate of mind, she turned away.\r\n\r\n“Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her. “I’ve something\r\nimportant to say!”\r\n\r\nThis sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\r\n\r\n“Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n“Is that all?” said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\r\ncould.\r\n\r\n“No,” said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\nAlice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,\r\nand perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For\r\nsome minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded\r\nits arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, “So you\r\nthink you’re changed, do you?”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’t remember things as I\r\nused—and I don’t keep the same size for ten minutes together!”\r\n\r\n“Can’t remember _what_ things?” said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ve tried to say “How doth the little busy bee,” but it all\r\ncame different!” Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.\r\n\r\n“Repeat, ‘_You are old, Father William_,’” said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\nAlice folded her hands, and began:—\r\n\r\n“You are old, Father William,” the young man said,\r\n    “And your hair has become very white;\r\nAnd yet you incessantly stand on your head—\r\n    Do you think, at your age, it is right?”\r\n\r\n“In my youth,” Father William replied to his son,\r\n    “I feared it might injure the brain;\r\nBut, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,\r\n    Why, I do it again and again.”\r\n\r\n“You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before,\r\n    And have grown most uncommonly fat;\r\nYet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—\r\n    Pray, what is the reason of that?”\r\n\r\n“In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\r\n    “I kept all my limbs very supple\r\nBy the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—\r\n    Allow me to sell you a couple?”\r\n\r\n“You are old,” said the youth, “and your jaws are too weak\r\n    For anything tougher than suet;\r\nYet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—\r\n    Pray, how did you manage to do it?”\r\n\r\n“In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law,\r\n    And argued each case with my wife;\r\nAnd the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\r\n    Has lasted the rest of my life.”\r\n\r\n“You are old,” said the youth, “one would hardly suppose\r\n    That your eye was as steady as ever;\r\nYet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—\r\n    What made you so awfully clever?”\r\n\r\n“I have answered three questions, and that is enough,”\r\n    Said his father; “don’t give yourself airs!\r\nDo you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\r\n    Be off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!”\r\n\r\n\r\n“That is not said right,” said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n“Not _quite_ right, I’m afraid,” said Alice, timidly; “some of the\r\nwords have got altered.”\r\n\r\n“It is wrong from beginning to end,” said the Caterpillar decidedly,\r\nand there was silence for some minutes.\r\n\r\nThe Caterpillar was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n“What size do you want to be?” it asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” Alice hastily replied; “only one\r\ndoesn’t like changing so often, you know.”\r\n\r\n“I _don’t_ know,” said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\nAlice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life\r\nbefore, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\r\n\r\n“Are you content now?” said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n“Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn’t\r\nmind,” said Alice: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.”\r\n\r\n“It is a very good height indeed!” said the Caterpillar angrily,\r\nrearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\r\n\r\n“But I’m not used to it!” pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she\r\nthought of herself, “I wish the creatures wouldn’t be so easily\r\noffended!”\r\n\r\n“You’ll get used to it in time,” said the Caterpillar; and it put the\r\nhookah into its mouth and began smoking again.\r\n\r\nThis time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a\r\nminute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and\r\nyawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the\r\nmushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\r\n“One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you\r\ngrow shorter.”\r\n\r\n“One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_” thought Alice to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n“Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\r\naloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\r\n\r\nAlice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,\r\ntrying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was\r\nperfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at\r\nlast she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke\r\noff a bit of the edge with each hand.\r\n\r\n“And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\r\nthe right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a\r\nviolent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\r\n\r\nShe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\r\nthat there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\r\nset to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\r\nso closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\r\nmouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\r\nlefthand bit.\r\n\r\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n“Come, my head’s free at last!” said Alice in a tone of delight, which\r\nchanged into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\r\nwere nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was\r\nan immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\r\nsea of green leaves that lay far below her.\r\n\r\n“What _can_ all that green stuff be?” said Alice. “And where _have_ my\r\nshoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?”\r\nShe was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,\r\nexcept a little shaking among the distant green leaves.\r\n\r\nAs there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,\r\nshe tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that\r\nher neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She\r\nhad just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was\r\ngoing to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but\r\nthe tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp\r\nhiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her\r\nface, and was beating her violently with its wings.\r\n\r\n“Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon.\r\n\r\n“I’m _not_ a serpent!” said Alice indignantly. “Let me alone!”\r\n\r\n“Serpent, I say again!” repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued\r\ntone, and added with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, and nothing\r\nseems to suit them!”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice.\r\n\r\n“I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried\r\nhedges,” the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; “but those\r\nserpents! There’s no pleasing them!”\r\n\r\nAlice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\r\nsaying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\r\n\r\n“As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon;\r\n“but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I\r\nhaven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!”\r\n\r\n“I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was beginning to\r\nsee its meaning.\r\n\r\n“And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the\r\nPigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I\r\nshould be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down\r\nfrom the sky! Ugh, Serpent!”\r\n\r\n“But I’m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!” said Alice. “I’m a—I’m a—”\r\n\r\n“Well! _What_ are you?” said the Pigeon. “I can see you’re trying to\r\ninvent something!”\r\n\r\n“I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\r\nthe number of changes she had gone through that day.\r\n\r\n“A likely story indeed!” said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\r\ncontempt. “I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never\r\n_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s\r\nno use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never\r\ntasted an egg!”\r\n\r\n“I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a very truthful\r\nchild; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do, why then\r\nthey’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.”\r\n\r\nThis was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\r\nminute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re\r\nlooking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to\r\nme whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?”\r\n\r\n“It matters a good deal to _me_,” said Alice hastily; “but I’m not\r\nlooking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want\r\n_yours_: I don’t like them raw.”\r\n\r\n“Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\r\ndown again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well\r\nas she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,\r\nand every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while\r\nshe remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,\r\nand she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at\r\nthe other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until\r\nshe had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\r\n\r\nIt was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\r\nfelt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\r\nand began talking to herself, as usual. “Come, there’s half my plan\r\ndone now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m\r\ngoing to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my\r\nright size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how\r\n_is_ that to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly\r\nupon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\r\n“Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come upon them\r\n_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So she\r\nbegan nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go\r\nnear the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nPig and Pepper\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\r\nto do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\r\nwood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\r\notherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\r\nfish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by\r\nanother footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\r\nfrog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled\r\nall over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all\r\nabout, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\r\n\r\nThe Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\r\nnearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\r\nsaying, in a solemn tone, “For the Duchess. An invitation from the\r\nQueen to play croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn\r\ntone, only changing the order of the words a little, “From the Queen.\r\nAn invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.”\r\n\r\nThen they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\r\n\r\nAlice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood\r\nfor fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\r\nFish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\r\ndoor, staring stupidly up into the sky.\r\n\r\nAlice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\r\n\r\n“There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for\r\ntwo reasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you\r\nare; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could\r\npossibly hear you.” And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary\r\nnoise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now\r\nand then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to\r\npieces.\r\n\r\n“Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”\r\n\r\n“There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went on\r\nwithout attending to her, “if we had the door between us. For instance,\r\nif you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you\r\nknow.” He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and\r\nthis Alice thought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he can’t help it,”\r\nshe said to herself; “his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his\r\nhead. But at any rate he might answer questions.—How am I to get in?”\r\nshe repeated, aloud.\r\n\r\n“I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\r\nskimming out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose,\r\nand broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\r\n\r\n“—or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\r\nas if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\n“How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\r\n\r\n“_Are_ you to get in at all?” said the Footman. “That’s the first\r\nquestion, you know.”\r\n\r\nIt was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. “It’s really\r\ndreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all the creatures argue.\r\nIt’s enough to drive one crazy!”\r\n\r\nThe Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\r\nremark, with variations. “I shall sit here,” he said, “on and off, for\r\ndays and days.”\r\n\r\n“But what am _I_ to do?” said Alice.\r\n\r\n“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.\r\n\r\n“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s\r\nperfectly idiotic!” And she opened the door and went in.\r\n\r\nThe door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\r\none end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool\r\nin the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,\r\nstirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.\r\n\r\n“There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to\r\nherself, as well as she could for sneezing.\r\n\r\nThere was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed\r\noccasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\r\nalternately without a moment’s pause. The only things in the kitchen\r\nthat did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting\r\non the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\r\n\r\n“Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\r\nnot quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, “why\r\nyour cat grins like that?”\r\n\r\n“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why. Pig!”\r\n\r\nShe said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\r\njumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the\r\nbaby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:—\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t\r\nknow that cats _could_ grin.”\r\n\r\n“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely, feeling quite\r\npleased to have got into a conversation.\r\n\r\n“You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’s a fact.”\r\n\r\nAlice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\r\nbe as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she\r\nwas trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\r\nfire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\r\nthe Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a\r\nshower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\r\nthem even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\r\nthat it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\r\n\r\n“Oh, _please_ mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down\r\nin an agony of terror. “Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!” as an\r\nunusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it\r\noff.\r\n\r\n“If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a hoarse\r\ngrowl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”\r\n\r\n“Which would _not_ be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to\r\nget an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. “Just\r\nthink of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the\r\nearth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”\r\n\r\n“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off her head!”\r\n\r\nAlice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\r\nthe hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\r\nbe listening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or\r\nis it twelve? I—”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t bother _me_,” said the Duchess; “I never could abide\r\nfigures!” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a\r\nsort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at\r\nthe end of every line:\r\n\r\n“Speak roughly to your little boy,\r\n    And beat him when he sneezes:\r\nHe only does it to annoy,\r\n    Because he knows it teases.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n(In which the cook and the baby joined):\r\n\r\n\r\n“Wow! wow! wow!”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\r\nthe baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\r\nthat Alice could hardly hear the words:—\r\n\r\n“I speak severely to my boy,\r\n    I beat him when he sneezes;\r\nFor he can thoroughly enjoy\r\n    The pepper when he pleases!”\r\n\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Wow! wow! wow!”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!” the Duchess said to Alice,\r\nflinging the baby at her as she spoke. “I must go and get ready to play\r\ncroquet with the Queen,” and she hurried out of the room. The cook\r\nthrew a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.\r\n\r\nAlice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\r\nlittle creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,\r\n“just like a star-fish,” thought Alice. The poor little thing was\r\nsnorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling\r\nitself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for\r\nthe first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to\r\ntwist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\r\near and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it\r\nout into the open air. “If I don’t take this child away with me,”\r\nthought Alice, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be\r\nmurder to leave it behind?” She said the last words out loud, and the\r\nlittle thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).\r\n“Don’t grunt,” said Alice; “that’s not at all a proper way of\r\nexpressing yourself.”\r\n\r\nThe baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face\r\nto see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had\r\na _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also\r\nits eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did\r\nnot like the look of the thing at all. “But perhaps it was only\r\nsobbing,” she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there\r\nwere any tears.\r\n\r\nNo, there were no tears. “If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,”\r\nsaid Alice, seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind\r\nnow!” The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\r\nto say which), and they went on for some while in silence.\r\n\r\nAlice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do\r\nwith this creature when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so\r\nviolently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time\r\nthere could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than\r\na pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nSo she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it\r\ntrot away quietly into the wood. “If it had grown up,” she said to\r\nherself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\r\nrather a handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking over other\r\nchildren she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\r\nto herself, “if one only knew the right way to change them—” when she\r\nwas a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of\r\na tree a few yards off.\r\n\r\nThe Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she\r\nthought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she\r\nfelt that it ought to be treated with respect.\r\n\r\n“Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\r\nwhether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little\r\nwider. “Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went on.\r\n“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”\r\n\r\n“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.\r\n\r\n“I don’t much care where—” said Alice.\r\n\r\n“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.\r\n\r\n“—so long as I get _somewhere_,” Alice added as an explanation.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long\r\nenough.”\r\n\r\nAlice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another\r\nquestion. “What sort of people live about here?”\r\n\r\n“In _that_ direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives\r\na Hatter: and in _that_ direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a\r\nMarch Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad.”\r\n\r\n“But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m mad.\r\nYou’re mad.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice.\r\n\r\n“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have come here.”\r\n\r\nAlice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on “And how\r\ndo you know that you’re mad?”\r\n\r\n“To begin with,” said the Cat, “a dog’s not mad. You grant that?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose so,” said Alice.\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see, a dog growls when it’s angry,\r\nand wags its tail when it’s pleased. Now _I_ growl when I’m pleased,\r\nand wag my tail when I’m angry. Therefore I’m mad.”\r\n\r\n“_I_ call it purring, not growling,” said Alice.\r\n\r\n“Call it what you like,” said the Cat. “Do you play croquet with the\r\nQueen to-day?”\r\n\r\n“I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but I haven’t been invited\r\nyet.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished.\r\n\r\nAlice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\r\nthings happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,\r\nit suddenly appeared again.\r\n\r\n“By-the-bye, what became of the baby?” said the Cat. “I’d nearly\r\nforgotten to ask.”\r\n\r\n“It turned into a pig,” Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back\r\nin a natural way.\r\n\r\n“I thought it would,” said the Cat, and vanished again.\r\n\r\nAlice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\r\nappear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\r\nwhich the March Hare was said to live. “I’ve seen hatters before,” she\r\nsaid to herself; “the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and\r\nperhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it\r\nwas in March.” As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat\r\nagain, sitting on a branch of a tree.\r\n\r\n“Did you say pig, or fig?” said the Cat.\r\n\r\n“I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing\r\nand vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\r\nbeginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\r\nremained some time after the rest of it had gone.\r\n\r\n“Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a\r\ngrin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!”\r\n\r\nShe had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of\r\nthe March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\r\nchimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It\r\nwas so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\r\nnibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself\r\nto about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather\r\ntimidly, saying to herself “Suppose it should be raving mad after all!\r\nI almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nA Mad Tea-Party\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\r\nMarch Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\r\nbetween them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\r\ncushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. “Very\r\nuncomfortable for the Dormouse,” thought Alice; “only, as it’s asleep,\r\nI suppose it doesn’t mind.”\r\n\r\nThe table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\r\none corner of it: “No room! No room!” they cried out when they saw\r\nAlice coming. “There’s _plenty_ of room!” said Alice indignantly, and\r\nshe sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\r\n\r\n“Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\r\n\r\nAlice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.\r\n“I don’t see any wine,” she remarked.\r\n\r\n“There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.\r\n\r\n“Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said Alice angrily.\r\n\r\n“It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,” said\r\nthe March Hare.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know it was _your_ table,” said Alice; “it’s laid for a great\r\nmany more than three.”\r\n\r\n“Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter. He had been looking at\r\nAlice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n“You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some\r\nseverity; “it’s very rude.”\r\n\r\nThe Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_\r\nwas, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”\r\n\r\n“Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they’ve\r\nbegun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?” said\r\nthe March Hare.\r\n\r\n“Exactly so,” said Alice.\r\n\r\n“Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.\r\n\r\n“I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I\r\nsay—that’s the same thing, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Not the same thing a bit!” said the Hatter. “You might just as well\r\nsay that ‘I see what I eat’ is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see’!”\r\n\r\n“You might just as well say,” added the March Hare, “that ‘I like what\r\nI get’ is the same thing as ‘I get what I like’!”\r\n\r\n“You might just as well say,” added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\r\ntalking in his sleep, “that ‘I breathe when I sleep’ is the same thing\r\nas ‘I sleep when I breathe’!”\r\n\r\n“It _is_ the same thing with you,” said the Hatter, and here the\r\nconversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while\r\nAlice thought over all she could remember about ravens and\r\nwriting-desks, which wasn’t much.\r\n\r\nThe Hatter was the first to break the silence. “What day of the month\r\nis it?” he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\r\npocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\r\nand holding it to his ear.\r\n\r\nAlice considered a little, and then said “The fourth.”\r\n\r\n“Two days wrong!” sighed the Hatter. “I told you butter wouldn’t suit\r\nthe works!” he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\r\n\r\n“It was the _best_ butter,” the March Hare meekly replied.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,” the Hatter grumbled:\r\n“you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.”\r\n\r\nThe March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\r\nit into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\r\nnothing better to say than his first remark, “It was the _best_ butter,\r\nyou know.”\r\n\r\nAlice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. “What a\r\nfunny watch!” she remarked. “It tells the day of the month, and doesn’t\r\ntell what o’clock it is!”\r\n\r\n“Why should it?” muttered the Hatter. “Does _your_ watch tell you what\r\nyear it is?”\r\n\r\n“Of course not,” Alice replied very readily: “but that’s because it\r\nstays the same year for such a long time together.”\r\n\r\n“Which is just the case with _mine_,” said the Hatter.\r\n\r\nAlice felt dreadfully puzzled, The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no\r\nsort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. “I don’t quite\r\nunderstand you,” she said, as politely as she could.\r\n\r\n“The Dormouse is asleep again,” said the Hatter, and he poured a little\r\nhot tea upon its nose.\r\n\r\nThe Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\r\neyes, “Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.”\r\n\r\n“Have you guessed the riddle yet?” the Hatter said, turning to Alice\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“No, I give it up,” Alice replied: “what’s the answer?”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Hatter.\r\n\r\n“Nor I,” said the March Hare.\r\n\r\nAlice sighed wearily. “I think you might do something better with the\r\ntime,” she said, “than waste it in asking riddles that have no\r\nanswers.”\r\n\r\n“If you knew Time as well as I do,” said the Hatter, “you wouldn’t talk\r\nabout wasting _it_. It’s _him_.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what you mean,” said Alice.\r\n\r\n“Of course you don’t!” the Hatter said, tossing his head\r\ncontemptuously. “I dare say you never even spoke to Time!”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but I know I have to beat\r\ntime when I learn music.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! that accounts for it,” said the Hatter. “He won’t stand beating.\r\nNow, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything\r\nyou liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in\r\nthe morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a\r\nhint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\r\ntime for dinner!”\r\n\r\n(“I only wish it was,” the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\r\n\r\n“That would be grand, certainly,” said Alice thoughtfully: “but then—I\r\nshouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Not at first, perhaps,” said the Hatter: “but you could keep it to\r\nhalf-past one as long as you liked.”\r\n\r\n“Is that the way _you_ manage?” Alice asked.\r\n\r\nThe Hatter shook his head mournfully. “Not I!” he replied. “We\r\nquarrelled last March—just before _he_ went mad, you know—” (pointing\r\nwith his tea spoon at the March Hare,) “—it was at the great concert\r\ngiven by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\r\n\r\n‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\r\nHow I wonder what you’re at!’\r\n\r\n\r\nYou know the song, perhaps?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve heard something like it,” said Alice.\r\n\r\n“It goes on, you know,” the Hatter continued, “in this way:—\r\n\r\n‘Up above the world you fly,\r\nLike a tea-tray in the sky.\r\n                    Twinkle, twinkle—’”\r\n\r\n\r\nHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep\r\n“_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_—” and went on so long that they\r\nhad to pinch it to make it stop.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,” said the Hatter, “when the\r\nQueen jumped up and bawled out, ‘He’s murdering the time! Off with his\r\nhead!’”\r\n\r\n“How dreadfully savage!” exclaimed Alice.\r\n\r\n“And ever since that,” the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, “he won’t\r\ndo a thing I ask! It’s always six o’clock now.”\r\n\r\nA bright idea came into Alice’s head. “Is that the reason so many\r\ntea-things are put out here?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s it,” said the Hatter with a sigh: “it’s always tea-time,\r\nand we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.”\r\n\r\n“Then you keep moving round, I suppose?” said Alice.\r\n\r\n“Exactly so,” said the Hatter: “as the things get used up.”\r\n\r\n“But what happens when you come to the beginning again?” Alice ventured\r\nto ask.\r\n\r\n“Suppose we change the subject,” the March Hare interrupted, yawning.\r\n“I’m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid I don’t know one,” said Alice, rather alarmed at the\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\n“Then the Dormouse shall!” they both cried. “Wake up, Dormouse!” And\r\nthey pinched it on both sides at once.\r\n\r\nThe Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. “I wasn’t asleep,” he said in a\r\nhoarse, feeble voice: “I heard every word you fellows were saying.”\r\n\r\n“Tell us a story!” said the March Hare.\r\n\r\n“Yes, please do!” pleaded Alice.\r\n\r\n“And be quick about it,” added the Hatter, “or you’ll be asleep again\r\nbefore it’s done.”\r\n\r\n“Once upon a time there were three little sisters,” the Dormouse began\r\nin a great hurry; “and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\r\nthey lived at the bottom of a well—”\r\n\r\n“What did they live on?” said Alice, who always took a great interest\r\nin questions of eating and drinking.\r\n\r\n“They lived on treacle,” said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\n“They couldn’t have done that, you know,” Alice gently remarked;\r\n“they’d have been ill.”\r\n\r\n“So they were,” said the Dormouse; “_very_ ill.”\r\n\r\nAlice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary way of\r\nliving would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: “But\r\nwhy did they live at the bottom of a well?”\r\n\r\n“Take some more tea,” the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\r\n\r\n“I’ve had nothing yet,” Alice replied in an offended tone, “so I can’t\r\ntake more.”\r\n\r\n“You mean you can’t take _less_,” said the Hatter: “it’s very easy to\r\ntake _more_ than nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Nobody asked _your_ opinion,” said Alice.\r\n\r\n“Who’s making personal remarks now?” the Hatter asked triumphantly.\r\n\r\nAlice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to\r\nsome tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\r\nrepeated her question. “Why did they live at the bottom of a well?”\r\n\r\nThe Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\r\nsaid, “It was a treacle-well.”\r\n\r\n“There’s no such thing!” Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\r\nHatter and the March Hare went “Sh! sh!” and the Dormouse sulkily\r\nremarked, “If you can’t be civil, you’d better finish the story for\r\nyourself.”\r\n\r\n“No, please go on!” Alice said very humbly; “I won’t interrupt again. I\r\ndare say there may be _one_.”\r\n\r\n“One, indeed!” said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\r\ngo on. “And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw,\r\nyou know—”\r\n\r\n“What did they draw?” said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\r\n\r\n“Treacle,” said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\r\n\r\n“I want a clean cup,” interrupted the Hatter: “let’s all move one place\r\non.”\r\n\r\nHe moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\r\nmoved into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the\r\nplace of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\r\nadvantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\r\nbefore, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\r\n\r\nAlice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\r\ncautiously: “But I don’t understand. Where did they draw the treacle\r\nfrom?”\r\n\r\n“You can draw water out of a water-well,” said the Hatter; “so I should\r\nthink you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid?”\r\n\r\n“But they were _in_ the well,” Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing\r\nto notice this last remark.\r\n\r\n“Of course they were,” said the Dormouse; “—well in.”\r\n\r\nThis answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for\r\nsome time without interrupting it.\r\n\r\n“They were learning to draw,” the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\r\nits eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; “and they drew all manner of\r\nthings—everything that begins with an M—”\r\n\r\n“Why with an M?” said Alice.\r\n\r\n“Why not?” said the March Hare.\r\n\r\nAlice was silent.\r\n\r\nThe Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a\r\ndoze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a\r\nlittle shriek, and went on: “—that begins with an M, such as\r\nmouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say\r\nthings are “much of a muchness”—did you ever see such a thing as a\r\ndrawing of a muchness?”\r\n\r\n“Really, now you ask me,” said Alice, very much confused, “I don’t\r\nthink—”\r\n\r\n“Then you shouldn’t talk,” said the Hatter.\r\n\r\nThis piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\r\ngreat disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\r\nneither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\r\nlooked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\r\nthe last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into\r\nthe teapot.\r\n\r\n“At any rate I’ll never go _there_ again!” said Alice as she picked her\r\nway through the wood. “It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in\r\nall my life!”\r\n\r\nJust as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door\r\nleading right into it. “That’s very curious!” she thought. “But\r\neverything’s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.” And\r\nin she went.\r\n\r\nOnce more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little\r\nglass table. “Now, I’ll manage better this time,” she said to herself,\r\nand began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that\r\nled into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom\r\n(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot\r\nhigh: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_—she found\r\nherself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds\r\nand the cool fountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nThe Queen’s Croquet-Ground\r\n\r\n\r\nA large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses\r\ngrowing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\r\npainting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she\r\nwent nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard\r\none of them say, “Look out now, Five! Don’t go splashing paint over me\r\nlike that!”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t help it,” said Five, in a sulky tone; “Seven jogged my\r\nelbow.”\r\n\r\nOn which Seven looked up and said, “That’s right, Five! Always lay the\r\nblame on others!”\r\n\r\n“_You’d_ better not talk!” said Five. “I heard the Queen say only\r\nyesterday you deserved to be beheaded!”\r\n\r\n“What for?” said the one who had spoken first.\r\n\r\n“That’s none of _your_ business, Two!” said Seven.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it _is_ his business!” said Five, “and I’ll tell him—it was for\r\nbringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.”\r\n\r\nSeven flung down his brush, and had just begun “Well, of all the unjust\r\nthings—” when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching\r\nthem, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,\r\nand all of them bowed low.\r\n\r\n“Would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, “why you are\r\npainting those roses?”\r\n\r\nFive and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low\r\nvoice, “Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a\r\n_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen\r\nwas to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So\r\nyou see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—” At this\r\nmoment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\r\nout “The Queen! The Queen!” and the three gardeners instantly threw\r\nthemselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,\r\nand Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.\r\n\r\nFirst came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the\r\nthree gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\r\ncorners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\r\ndiamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came\r\nthe royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\r\njumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all\r\nornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,\r\nand among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a\r\nhurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went\r\nby without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying\r\nthe King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\r\ngrand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\r\n\r\nAlice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\r\nlike the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\r\nof such a rule at processions; “and besides, what would be the use of a\r\nprocession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie down upon their\r\nfaces, so that they couldn’t see it?” So she stood still where she was,\r\nand waited.\r\n\r\nWhen the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\r\nat her, and the Queen said severely “Who is this?” She said it to the\r\nKnave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\r\n\r\n“Idiot!” said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to\r\nAlice, she went on, “What’s your name, child?”\r\n\r\n“My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,” said Alice very politely;\r\nbut she added, to herself, “Why, they’re only a pack of cards, after\r\nall. I needn’t be afraid of them!”\r\n\r\n“And who are _these?_” said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners\r\nwho were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on\r\ntheir faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of\r\nthe pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,\r\nor courtiers, or three of her own children.\r\n\r\n“How should _I_ know?” said Alice, surprised at her own courage. “It’s\r\nno business of _mine_.”\r\n\r\nThe Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\r\nmoment like a wild beast, screamed “Off with her head! Off—”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nThe King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said “Consider, my\r\ndear: she is only a child!”\r\n\r\nThe Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave “Turn\r\nthem over!”\r\n\r\nThe Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\r\n\r\n“Get up!” said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three\r\ngardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,\r\nthe royal children, and everybody else.\r\n\r\n“Leave off that!” screamed the Queen. “You make me giddy.” And then,\r\nturning to the rose-tree, she went on, “What _have_ you been doing\r\nhere?”\r\n\r\n“May it please your Majesty,” said Two, in a very humble tone, going\r\ndown on one knee as he spoke, “we were trying—”\r\n\r\n“_I_ see!” said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.\r\n“Off with their heads!” and the procession moved on, three of the\r\nsoldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran\r\nto Alice for protection.\r\n\r\n“You shan’t be beheaded!” said Alice, and she put them into a large\r\nflower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a\r\nminute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n“Are their heads off?” shouted the Queen.\r\n\r\n“Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!” the soldiers shouted\r\nin reply.\r\n\r\n“That’s right!” shouted the Queen. “Can you play croquet?”\r\n\r\nThe soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was\r\nevidently meant for her.\r\n\r\n“Yes!” shouted Alice.\r\n\r\n“Come on, then!” roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,\r\nwondering very much what would happen next.\r\n\r\n“It’s—it’s a very fine day!” said a timid voice at her side. She was\r\nwalking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\r\n\r\n“Very,” said Alice: “—where’s the Duchess?”\r\n\r\n“Hush! Hush!” said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked\r\nanxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\r\ntiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered “She’s under\r\nsentence of execution.”\r\n\r\n“What for?” said Alice.\r\n\r\n“Did you say ‘What a pity!’?” the Rabbit asked.\r\n\r\n“No, I didn’t,” said Alice: “I don’t think it’s at all a pity. I said\r\n‘What for?’”\r\n\r\n“She boxed the Queen’s ears—” the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little\r\nscream of laughter. “Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whispered in a frightened\r\ntone. “The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the\r\nQueen said—”\r\n\r\n“Get to your places!” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\r\npeople began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\r\nother; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\r\nbegan. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground\r\nin her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live\r\nhedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double\r\nthemselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\r\nshe succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,\r\nunder her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she\r\nhad got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the\r\nhedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look\r\nup in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help\r\nbursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was\r\ngoing to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog\r\nhad unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all\r\nthis, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\r\nwanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were\r\nalways getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice\r\nsoon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\r\n\r\nThe players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\r\nall the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time\r\nthe Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\r\nshouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” about once in a\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nAlice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\r\ndispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\r\n“and then,” thought she, “what would become of me? They’re dreadfully\r\nfond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any\r\none left alive!”\r\n\r\nShe was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\r\ncould get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious\r\nappearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after\r\nwatching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said\r\nto herself “It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk\r\nto.”\r\n\r\n“How are you getting on?” said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\r\nenough for it to speak with.\r\n\r\nAlice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. “It’s no use\r\nspeaking to it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at least one\r\nof them.” In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\r\ndown her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\r\nshe had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there\r\nwas enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, in rather a\r\ncomplaining tone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear\r\noneself speak—and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular; at\r\nleast, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve no idea how\r\nconfusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the\r\narch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\r\nground—and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now, only\r\nit ran away when it saw mine coming!”\r\n\r\n“How do you like the Queen?” said the Cat in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” said Alice: “she’s so extremely—” Just then she noticed\r\nthat the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\r\n“—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.”\r\n\r\nThe Queen smiled and passed on.\r\n\r\n“Who _are_ you talking to?” said the King, going up to Alice, and\r\nlooking at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.\r\n\r\n“It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said Alice: “allow me to\r\nintroduce it.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the King: “however, it may\r\nkiss my hand if it likes.”\r\n\r\n“I’d rather not,” the Cat remarked.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be impertinent,” said the King, “and don’t look at me like\r\nthat!” He got behind Alice as he spoke.\r\n\r\n“A cat may look at a king,” said Alice. “I’ve read that in some book,\r\nbut I don’t remember where.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it must be removed,” said the King very decidedly, and he called\r\nthe Queen, who was passing at the moment, “My dear! I wish you would\r\nhave this cat removed!”\r\n\r\nThe Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or\r\nsmall. “Off with his head!” she said, without even looking round.\r\n\r\n“I’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said the King eagerly, and he\r\nhurried off.\r\n\r\nAlice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\r\non, as she heard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with\r\npassion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\r\nexecuted for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\r\nof things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\r\nwhether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\r\n\r\nThe hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\r\nto Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\r\nother: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to\r\nthe other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a\r\nhelpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.\r\n\r\nBy the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\r\nwas over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t\r\nmatter much,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from this side\r\nof the ground.” So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\r\nescape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nWhen she got back to the Ches"

His parents were very hard-working\r\nand deeply religious people, but so poor that they lived with their five\r\nchildren in only two rooms. The father and mother spent their evenings\r\nin reading aloud to their children, generally from books of a serious\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThough always sickly and delicate Dostoevsky came out third in the\r\nfinal examination of the Petersburg school of Engineering. There he had\r\nalready begun his first work, “Poor Folk.”\r\n\r\nThis story was published by the poet Nekrassov in his review and\r\nwas received with acclamations. The shy, unknown youth found himself\r\ninstantly something of a celebrity. A brilliant and successful career\r\nseemed to open before him, but those hopes were soon dashed. In 1849 he\r\nwas arrested.\r\n\r\nThough neither by temperament nor conviction a revolutionist, Dostoevsky\r\nwas one of a little group of young men who met together to read Fourier\r\nand Proudhon. He was accused of “taking part in conversations against\r\nthe censorship, of reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and of\r\nknowing of the intention to set up a printing press.” Under Nicholas\r\nI. (that “stern and just man,” as Maurice Baring calls him) this was\r\nenough, and he was condemned to death. After eight months’ imprisonment\r\nhe was with twenty-one others taken out to the Semyonovsky Square to\r\nbe shot. Writing to his brother Mihail, Dostoevsky says: “They snapped\r\nwords over our heads, and they made us put on the white shirts worn by\r\npersons condemned to death. Thereupon we were bound in threes to stakes,\r\nto suffer execution. Being the third in the row, I concluded I had only\r\na few minutes of life before me. I thought of you and your dear ones and\r\nI contrived to kiss Plestcheiev and Dourov, who were next to me, and to\r\nbid them farewell. Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo, we were unbound,\r\nbrought back upon the scaffold, and informed that his Majesty had spared\r\nus our lives.” The sentence was commuted to hard labour.\r\n\r\nOne of the prisoners, Grigoryev, went mad as soon as he was untied, and\r\nnever regained his sanity.\r\n\r\nThe intense suffering of this experience left a lasting stamp on\r\nDostoevsky’s mind. Though his religious temper led him in the end to\r\naccept every suffering with resignation and to regard it as a blessing\r\nin his own case, he constantly recurs to the subject in his writings.\r\nHe describes the awful agony of the condemned man and insists on the\r\ncruelty of inflicting such torture. Then followed four years of penal\r\nservitude, spent in the company of common criminals in Siberia, where\r\nhe began the “Dead House,” and some years of service in a disciplinary\r\nbattalion.\r\n\r\nHe had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease before his arrest\r\nand this now developed into violent attacks of epilepsy, from which he\r\nsuffered for the rest of his life. The fits occurred three or four times\r\na year and were more frequent in periods of great strain. In 1859 he was\r\nallowed to return to Russia. He started a journal--“Vremya,” which was\r\nforbidden by the Censorship through a misunderstanding. In 1864 he lost\r\nhis first wife and his brother Mihail. He was in terrible poverty, yet\r\nhe took upon himself the payment of his brother’s debts. He started\r\nanother journal--“The Epoch,” which within a few months was also\r\nprohibited. He was weighed down by debt, his brother’s family was\r\ndependent on him, he was forced to write at heart-breaking speed, and is\r\nsaid never to have corrected his work. The later years of his life were\r\nmuch softened by the tenderness and devotion of his second wife.\r\n\r\nIn June 1880 he made his famous speech at the unveiling of the\r\nmonument to Pushkin in Moscow and he was received with extraordinary\r\ndemonstrations of love and honour.\r\n\r\nA few months later Dostoevsky died. He was followed to the grave by a\r\nvast multitude of mourners, who “gave the hapless man the funeral of a\r\nking.” He is still probably the most widely read writer in Russia.\r\n\r\nIn the words of a Russian critic, who seeks to explain the feeling\r\ninspired by Dostoevsky: “He was one of ourselves, a man of our blood and\r\nour bone, but one who has suffered and has seen so much more deeply than\r\nwe have his insight impresses us as wisdom... that wisdom of the heart\r\nwhich we seek that we may learn from it how to live. All his other\r\ngifts came to him from nature, this he won for himself and through it he\r\nbecame great.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRIME AND PUNISHMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nOn an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of\r\nthe garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as though\r\nin hesitation, towards K. bridge.\r\n\r\nHe had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His\r\ngarret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more\r\nlike a cupboard than a room. The landlady who provided him with garret,\r\ndinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time\r\nhe went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which\r\ninvariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young man had a\r\nsick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed. He was\r\nhopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.\r\n\r\nThis was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but\r\nfor some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition,\r\nverging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in\r\nhimself, and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not\r\nonly his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but the\r\nanxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. He had\r\ngiven up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all\r\ndesire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror\r\nfor him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her\r\ntrivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats\r\nand complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to\r\nlie--no, rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and\r\nslip out unseen.\r\n\r\nThis evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely\r\naware of his fears.\r\n\r\n“I want to attempt a thing _like that_ and am frightened by these\r\ntrifles,” he thought, with an odd smile. “Hm... yes, all is in a man’s\r\nhands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, that’s an axiom. It would\r\nbe interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a new\r\nstep, uttering a new word is what they fear most.... But I am talking\r\ntoo much. It’s because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is\r\nthat I chatter because I do nothing. I’ve learned to chatter this\r\nlast month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack the\r\nGiant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of _that_? Is\r\n_that_ serious? It is not serious at all. It’s simply a fantasy to amuse\r\nmyself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything.”\r\n\r\nThe heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle\r\nand the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and that\r\nspecial Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out\r\nof town in summer--all worked painfully upon the young man’s already\r\noverwrought nerves. The insufferable stench from the pot-houses, which\r\nare particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men\r\nwhom he met continually, although it was a working day, completed\r\nthe revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the profoundest\r\ndisgust gleamed for a moment in the young man’s refined face. He was,\r\nby the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim,\r\nwell-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sank\r\ninto deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness\r\nof mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring\r\nto observe it. From time to time, he would mutter something, from the\r\nhabit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. At these\r\nmoments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a\r\ntangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had scarcely tasted\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nHe was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would\r\nhave been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that quarter\r\nof the town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have\r\ncreated surprise. Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number\r\nof establishments of bad character, the preponderance of the trading\r\nand working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the\r\nheart of Petersburg, types so various were to be seen in the streets\r\nthat no figure, however queer, would have caused surprise. But there was\r\nsuch accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young man’s heart, that,\r\nin spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded his rags least\r\nof all in the street. It was a different matter when he met with\r\nacquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked\r\nmeeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown\r\nreason, was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy\r\ndray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: “Hey there, German\r\nhatter” bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him--the young\r\nman stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat. It was a tall\r\nround hat from Zimmerman’s, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all\r\ntorn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly\r\nfashion. Not shame, however, but quite another feeling akin to terror\r\nhad overtaken him.\r\n\r\n“I knew it,” he muttered in confusion, “I thought so! That’s the worst\r\nof all! Why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial detail might\r\nspoil the whole plan. Yes, my hat is too noticeable.... It looks absurd\r\nand that makes it noticeable.... With my rags I ought to wear a cap, any\r\nsort of old pancake, but not this grotesque thing. Nobody wears such\r\na hat, it would be noticed a mile off, it would be remembered.... What\r\nmatters is that people would remember it, and that would give them\r\na clue. For this business one should be as little conspicuous as\r\npossible.... Trifles, trifles are what matter! Why, it’s just such\r\ntrifles that always ruin everything....”\r\n\r\nHe had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gate\r\nof his lodging house: exactly seven hundred and thirty. He had counted\r\nthem once when he had been lost in dreams. At the time he had put no\r\nfaith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous\r\nbut daring recklessness. Now, a month later, he had begun to look upon\r\nthem differently, and, in spite of the monologues in which he jeered at\r\nhis own impotence and indecision, he had involuntarily come to regard\r\nthis “hideous” dream as an exploit to be attempted, although he\r\nstill did not realise this himself. He was positively going now for a\r\n“rehearsal” of his project, and at every step his excitement grew more\r\nand more violent.\r\n\r\nWith a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he went up to a huge house\r\nwhich on one side looked on to the canal, and on the other into the\r\nstreet. This house was let out in tiny tenements and was inhabited by\r\nworking people of all kinds--tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans of\r\nsorts, girls picking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc.\r\nThere was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the\r\ntwo courtyards of the house. Three or four door-keepers were employed on\r\nthe building. The young man was very glad to meet none of them, and\r\nat once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right, and up the\r\nstaircase. It was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiar\r\nwith it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these surroundings:\r\nin such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be dreaded.\r\n\r\n“If I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow came to pass that\r\nI were really going to do it?” he could not help asking himself as he\r\nreached the fourth storey. There his progress was barred by some porters\r\nwho were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat. He knew that the\r\nflat had been occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and his\r\nfamily. This German was moving out then, and so the fourth floor on this\r\nstaircase would be untenanted except by the old woman. “That’s a good\r\nthing anyway,” he thought to himself, as he rang the bell of the old\r\nwoman’s flat. The bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made of\r\ntin and not of copper. The little flats in such houses always have bells\r\nthat ring like that. He had forgotten the note of that bell, and now\r\nits peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something and to bring it\r\nclearly before him.... He started, his nerves were terribly overstrained\r\nby now. In a little while, the door was opened a tiny crack: the old\r\nwoman eyed her visitor with evident distrust through the crack, and\r\nnothing could be seen but her little eyes, glittering in the darkness.\r\nBut, seeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, and\r\nopened the door wide. The young man stepped into the dark entry, which\r\nwas partitioned off from the tiny kitchen. The old woman stood facing\r\nhim in silence and looking inquiringly at him. She was a diminutive,\r\nwithered up old woman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp\r\nlittle nose. Her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smeared\r\nwith oil, and she wore no kerchief over it. Round her thin long neck,\r\nwhich looked like a hen’s leg, was knotted some sort of flannel rag,\r\nand, in spite of the heat, there hung flapping on her shoulders, a mangy\r\nfur cape, yellow with age. The old woman coughed and groaned at every\r\ninstant. The young man must have looked at her with a rather peculiar\r\nexpression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her eyes again.\r\n\r\n“Raskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago,” the young man made\r\nhaste to mutter, with a half bow, remembering that he ought to be more\r\npolite.\r\n\r\n“I remember, my good sir, I remember quite well your coming here,” the\r\nold woman said distinctly, still keeping her inquiring eyes on his face.\r\n\r\n“And here... I am again on the same errand,” Raskolnikov continued, a\r\nlittle disconcerted and surprised at the old woman’s mistrust. “Perhaps\r\nshe is always like that though, only I did not notice it the other\r\ntime,” he thought with an uneasy feeling.\r\n\r\nThe old woman paused, as though hesitating; then stepped on one side,\r\nand pointing to the door of the room, she said, letting her visitor pass\r\nin front of her:\r\n\r\n“Step in, my good sir.”\r\n\r\nThe little room into which the young man walked, with yellow paper on\r\nthe walls, geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows, was brightly\r\nlighted up at that moment by the setting sun.\r\n\r\n“So the sun will shine like this _then_ too!” flashed as it were by\r\nchance through Raskolnikov’s mind, and with a rapid glance he scanned\r\neverything in the room, trying as far as possible to notice and\r\nremember its arrangement. But there was nothing special in the room. The\r\nfurniture, all very old and of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with\r\na huge bent wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a\r\ndressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows,\r\nchairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in yellow\r\nframes, representing German damsels with birds in their hands--that was\r\nall. In the corner a light was burning before a small ikon. Everything\r\nwas very clean; the floor and the furniture were brightly polished;\r\neverything shone.\r\n\r\n“Lizaveta’s work,” thought the young man. There was not a speck of dust\r\nto be seen in the whole flat.\r\n\r\n“It’s in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds such\r\ncleanliness,” Raskolnikov thought again, and he stole a curious glance\r\nat the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room, in\r\nwhich stood the old woman’s bed and chest of drawers and into which he\r\nhad never looked before. These two rooms made up the whole flat.\r\n\r\n“What do you want?” the old woman said severely, coming into the room\r\nand, as before, standing in front of him so as to look him straight in\r\nthe face.\r\n\r\n“I’ve brought something to pawn here,” and he drew out of his pocket\r\nan old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back of which was engraved a\r\nglobe; the chain was of steel.\r\n\r\n“But the time is up for your last pledge. The month was up the day\r\nbefore yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“I will bring you the interest for another month; wait a little.”\r\n\r\n“But that’s for me to do as I please, my good sir, to wait or to sell\r\nyour pledge at once.”\r\n\r\n“How much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Ivanovna?”\r\n\r\n“You come with such trifles, my good sir, it’s scarcely worth anything.\r\nI gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy it\r\nquite new at a jeweler’s for a rouble and a half.”\r\n\r\n“Give me four roubles for it, I shall redeem it, it was my father’s. I\r\nshall be getting some money soon.”\r\n\r\n“A rouble and a half, and interest in advance, if you like!”\r\n\r\n“A rouble and a half!” cried the young man.\r\n\r\n“Please yourself”--and the old woman handed him back the watch. The\r\nyoung man took it, and was so angry that he was on the point of going\r\naway; but checked himself at once, remembering that there was nowhere\r\nelse he could go, and that he had had another object also in coming.\r\n\r\n“Hand it over,” he said roughly.\r\n\r\nThe old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys, and disappeared behind\r\nthe curtain into the other room. The young man, left standing alone in\r\nthe middle of the room, listened inquisitively, thinking. He could hear\r\nher unlocking the chest of drawers.\r\n\r\n“It must be the top drawer,” he reflected. “So she carries the keys in\r\na pocket on the right. All in one bunch on a steel ring.... And there’s\r\none key there, three times as big as all the others, with deep notches;\r\nthat can’t be the key of the chest of drawers... then there must be some\r\nother chest or strong-box... that’s worth knowing. Strong-boxes always\r\nhave keys like that... but how degrading it all is.”\r\n\r\nThe old woman came back.\r\n\r\n“Here, sir: as we say ten copecks the rouble a month, so I must take\r\nfifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the month in advance. But\r\nfor the two roubles I lent you before, you owe me now twenty copecks\r\non the same reckoning in advance. That makes thirty-five copecks\r\naltogether. So I must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the\r\nwatch. Here it is.”\r\n\r\n“What! only a rouble and fifteen copecks now!”\r\n\r\n“Just so.”\r\n\r\nThe young man did not dispute it and took the money. He looked at the\r\nold woman, and was in no hurry to get away, as though there was still\r\nsomething he wanted to say or to do, but he did not himself quite know\r\nwhat.\r\n\r\n“I may be bringing you something else in a day or two, Alyona\r\nIvanovna--a valuable thing--silver--a cigarette-box, as soon as I get it\r\nback from a friend...” he broke off in confusion.\r\n\r\n“Well, we will talk about it then, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye--are you always at home alone, your sister is not here with\r\nyou?” He asked her as casually as possible as he went out into the\r\npassage.\r\n\r\n“What business is she of yours, my good sir?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, nothing particular, I simply asked. You are too quick.... Good-day,\r\nAlyona Ivanovna.”\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov went out in complete confusion. This confusion became more\r\nand more intense. As he went down the stairs, he even stopped short, two\r\nor three times, as though suddenly struck by some thought. When he was\r\nin the street he cried out, “Oh, God, how loathsome it all is! and\r\ncan I, can I possibly.... No, it’s nonsense, it’s rubbish!” he added\r\nresolutely. “And how could such an atrocious thing come into my head?\r\nWhat filthy things my heart is capable of. Yes, filthy above all,\r\ndisgusting, loathsome, loathsome!--and for a whole month I’ve been....”\r\n But no words, no exclamations, could express his agitation. The feeling\r\nof intense repulsion, which had begun to oppress and torture his heart\r\nwhile he was on his way to the old woman, had by now reached such a\r\npitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not know what to\r\ndo with himself to escape from his wretchedness. He walked along the\r\npavement like a drunken man, regardless of the passers-by, and jostling\r\nagainst them, and only came to his senses when he was in the next\r\nstreet. Looking round, he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern\r\nwhich was entered by steps leading from the pavement to the basement.\r\nAt that instant two drunken men came out at the door, and abusing and\r\nsupporting one another, they mounted the steps. Without stopping to\r\nthink, Raskolnikov went down the steps at once. Till that moment he had\r\nnever been into a tavern, but now he felt giddy and was tormented by a\r\nburning thirst. He longed for a drink of cold beer, and attributed his\r\nsudden weakness to the want of food. He sat down at a sticky little\r\ntable in a dark and dirty corner; ordered some beer, and eagerly drank\r\noff the first glassful. At once he felt easier; and his thoughts became\r\nclear.\r\n\r\n“All that’s nonsense,” he said hopefully, “and there is nothing in it\r\nall to worry about! It’s simply physical derangement. Just a glass of\r\nbeer, a piece of dry bread--and in one moment the brain is stronger,\r\nthe mind is clearer and the will is firm! Phew, how utterly petty it all\r\nis!”\r\n\r\nBut in spite of this scornful reflection, he was by now looking cheerful\r\nas though he were suddenly set free from a terrible burden: and he gazed\r\nround in a friendly way at the people in the room. But even at that\r\nmoment he had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also\r\nnot normal.\r\n\r\nThere were few people at the time in the tavern. Besides the two drunken\r\nmen he had met on the steps, a group consisting of about five men and\r\na girl with a concertina had gone out at the same time. Their departure\r\nleft the room quiet and rather empty. The persons still in the tavern\r\nwere a man who appeared to be an artisan, drunk, but not extremely so,\r\nsitting before a pot of beer, and his companion, a huge, stout man with\r\na grey beard, in a short full-skirted coat. He was very drunk: and had\r\ndropped asleep on the bench; every now and then, he began as though in\r\nhis sleep, cracking his fingers, with his arms wide apart and the upper\r\npart of his body bounding about on the bench, while he hummed some\r\nmeaningless refrain, trying to recall some such lines as these:\r\n\r\n   “His wife a year he fondly loved\r\n    His wife a--a year he--fondly loved.”\r\n\r\nOr suddenly waking up again:\r\n\r\n   “Walking along the crowded row\r\n    He met the one he used to know.”\r\n\r\nBut no one shared his enjoyment: his silent companion looked with\r\npositive hostility and mistrust at all these manifestations. There was\r\nanother man in the room who looked somewhat like a retired government\r\nclerk. He was sitting apart, now and then sipping from his pot and\r\nlooking round at the company. He, too, appeared to be in some agitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov was not used to crowds, and, as we said before, he avoided\r\nsociety of every sort, more especially of late. But now all at once he\r\nfelt a desire to be with other people. Something new seemed to be taking\r\nplace within him, and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company. He\r\nwas so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomy\r\nexcitement that he longed to rest, if only for a moment, in some other\r\nworld, whatever it might be; and, in spite of the filthiness of the\r\nsurroundings, he was glad now to stay in the tavern.\r\n\r\nThe master of the establishment was in another room, but he frequently\r\ncame down some steps into the main room, his jaunty, tarred boots with\r\nred turn-over tops coming into view each time before the rest of his\r\nperson. He wore a full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat,\r\nwith no cravat, and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like an\r\niron lock. At the counter stood a boy of about fourteen, and there was\r\nanother boy somewhat younger who handed whatever was wanted. On the\r\ncounter lay some sliced cucumber, some pieces of dried black bread, and\r\nsome fish, chopped up small, all smelling very bad. It was insufferably\r\nclose, and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five minutes in such\r\nan atmosphere might well make a man drunk.\r\n\r\nThere are chance meetings with strangers that interest us from the\r\nfirst moment, before a word is spoken. Such was the impression made on\r\nRaskolnikov by the person sitting a little distance from him, who looked\r\nlike a retired clerk. The young man often recalled this impression\r\nafterwards, and even ascribed it to presentiment. He looked repeatedly\r\nat the clerk, partly no doubt because the latter was staring\r\npersistently at him, obviously anxious to enter into conversation. At\r\nthe other persons in the room, including the tavern-keeper, the clerk\r\nlooked as though he were used to their company, and weary of it, showing\r\na shade of condescending contempt for them as persons of station and\r\nculture inferior to his own, with whom it would be useless for him to\r\nconverse. He was a man over fifty, bald and grizzled, of medium height,\r\nand stoutly built. His face, bloated from continual drinking, was of\r\na yellow, even greenish, tinge, with swollen eyelids out of which keen\r\nreddish eyes gleamed like little chinks. But there was something very\r\nstrange in him; there was a light in his eyes as though of intense\r\nfeeling--perhaps there were even thought and intelligence, but at the\r\nsame time there was a gleam of something like madness. He was wearing an\r\nold and hopelessly ragged black dress coat, with all its buttons missing\r\nexcept one, and that one he had buttoned, evidently clinging to this\r\nlast trace of respectability. A crumpled shirt front, covered with spots\r\nand stains, protruded from his canvas waistcoat. Like a clerk, he wore\r\nno beard, nor moustache, but had been so long unshaven that his chin\r\nlooked like a stiff greyish brush. And there was something respectable\r\nand like an official about his manner too. But he was restless; he\r\nruffled up his hair and from time to time let his head drop into his\r\nhands dejectedly resting his ragged elbows on the stained and sticky\r\ntable. At last he looked straight at Raskolnikov, and said loudly and\r\nresolutely:\r\n\r\n“May I venture, honoured sir, to engage you in polite conversation?\r\nForasmuch as, though your exterior would not command respect, my\r\nexperience admonishes me that you are a man of education and not\r\naccustomed to drinking. I have always respected education when in\r\nconjunction with genuine sentiments, and I am besides a titular\r\ncounsellor in rank. Marmeladov--such is my name; titular counsellor. I\r\nmake bold to inquire--have you been in the service?”\r\n\r\n“No, I am studying,” answered the young man, somewhat surprised at\r\nthe grandiloquent style of the speaker and also at being so directly\r\naddressed. In spite of the momentary desire he had just been feeling for\r\ncompany of any sort, on being actually spoken to he felt immediately his\r\nhabitual irritable and uneasy aversion for any stranger who approached\r\nor attempted to approach him.\r\n\r\n“A student then, or formerly a student,” cried the clerk. “Just what\r\nI thought! I’m a man of experience, immense experience, sir,” and he\r\ntapped his forehead with his fingers in self-approval. “You’ve been a\r\nstudent or have attended some learned institution!... But allow me....”\r\n He got up, staggered, took up his jug and glass, and sat down beside\r\nthe young man, facing him a little sideways. He was drunk, but spoke\r\nfluently and boldly, only occasionally losing the thread of his\r\nsentences and drawling his words. He pounced upon Raskolnikov as\r\ngreedily as though he too had not spoken to a soul for a month.\r\n\r\n“Honoured sir,” he began almost with solemnity, “poverty is not a vice,\r\nthat’s a true saying. Yet I know too that drunkenness is not a virtue,\r\nand that that’s even truer. But beggary, honoured sir, beggary is a\r\nvice. In poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul, but\r\nin beggary--never--no one. For beggary a man is not chased out of human\r\nsociety with a stick, he is swept out with a broom, so as to make it as\r\nhumiliating as possible; and quite right, too, forasmuch as in beggary\r\nI am ready to be the first to humiliate myself. Hence the pot-house!\r\nHonoured sir, a month ago Mr. Lebeziatnikov gave my wife a beating, and\r\nmy wife is a very different matter from me! Do you understand? Allow me\r\nto ask you another question out of simple curiosity: have you ever spent\r\na night on a hay barge, on the Neva?”\r\n\r\n“No, I have not happened to,” answered Raskolnikov. “What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ve just come from one and it’s the fifth night I’ve slept\r\nso....” He filled his glass, emptied it and paused. Bits of hay were in\r\nfact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his hair. It seemed quite\r\nprobable that he had not undressed or washed for the last five days.\r\nHis hands, particularly, were filthy. They were fat and red, with black\r\nnails.\r\n\r\nHis conversation seemed to excite a general though languid interest. The\r\nboys at the counter fell to sniggering. The innkeeper came down from the\r\nupper room, apparently on purpose to listen to the “funny fellow”\r\n and sat down at a little distance, yawning lazily, but with dignity.\r\nEvidently Marmeladov was a familiar figure here, and he had most\r\nlikely acquired his weakness for high-flown speeches from the habit of\r\nfrequently entering into conversation with strangers of all sorts in\r\nthe tavern. This habit develops into a necessity in some drunkards, and\r\nespecially in those who are looked after sharply and kept in order\r\nat home. Hence in the company of other drinkers they try to justify\r\nthemselves and even if possible obtain consideration.\r\n\r\n“Funny fellow!” pronounced the innkeeper. “And why don’t you work, why\r\naren’t you at your duty, if you are in the service?”\r\n\r\n“Why am I not at my duty, honoured sir,” Marmeladov went on, addressing\r\nhimself exclusively to Raskolnikov, as though it had been he who put\r\nthat question to him. “Why am I not at my duty? Does not my heart ache\r\nto think what a useless worm I am? A month ago when Mr. Lebeziatnikov\r\nbeat my wife with his own hands, and I lay drunk, didn’t I suffer?\r\nExcuse me, young man, has it ever happened to you... hm... well, to\r\npetition hopelessly for a loan?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it has. But what do you mean by hopelessly?”\r\n\r\n“Hopelessly in the fullest sense, when you know beforehand that you\r\nwill get nothing by it. You know, for instance, beforehand with positive\r\ncertainty that this man, this most reputable and exemplary citizen, will\r\non no consideration give you money; and indeed I ask you why should he?\r\nFor he knows of course that I shan’t pay it back. From compassion? But\r\nMr. Lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern ideas explained the other day\r\nthat compassion is forbidden nowadays by science itself, and that that’s\r\nwhat is done now in England, where there is political economy. Why, I\r\nask you, should he give it to me? And yet though I know beforehand that\r\nhe won’t, I set off to him and...”\r\n\r\n“Why do you go?” put in Raskolnikov.\r\n\r\n“Well, when one has no one, nowhere else one can go! For every man must\r\nhave somewhere to go. Since there are times when one absolutely must\r\ngo somewhere! When my own daughter first went out with a yellow ticket,\r\nthen I had to go... (for my daughter has a yellow passport),” he added\r\nin parenthesis, looking with a certain uneasiness at the young man.\r\n“No matter, sir, no matter!” he went on hurriedly and with apparent\r\ncomposure when both the boys at the counter guffawed and even the\r\ninnkeeper smiled--“No matter, I am not confounded by the wagging of\r\ntheir heads; for everyone knows everything about it already, and all\r\nthat is secret is made open. And I accept it all, not with contempt, but\r\nwith humility. So be it! So be it! ‘Behold the man!’ Excuse me, young\r\nman, can you.... No, to put it more strongly and more distinctly; not\r\n_can_ you but _dare_ you, looking upon me, assert that I am not a pig?”\r\n\r\nThe young man did not answer a word.\r\n\r\n“Well,” the orator began again stolidly and with even increased dignity,\r\nafter waiting for the laughter in the room to subside. “Well, so be\r\nit, I am a pig, but she is a lady! I have the semblance of a beast, but\r\nKaterina Ivanovna, my spouse, is a person of education and an officer’s\r\ndaughter. Granted, granted, I am a scoundrel, but she is a woman of a\r\nnoble heart, full of sentiments, refined by education. And yet... oh,\r\nif only she felt for me! Honoured sir, honoured sir, you know every man\r\nought to have at least one place where people feel for him! But Katerina\r\nIvanovna, though she is magnanimous, she is unjust.... And yet, although\r\nI realise that when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity--for\r\nI repeat without being ashamed, she pulls my hair, young man,” he\r\ndeclared with redoubled dignity, hearing the sniggering again--“but, my\r\nGod, if she would but once.... But no, no! It’s all in vain and it’s no\r\nuse talking! No use talking! For more than once, my wish did come true\r\nand more than once she has felt for me but... such is my fate and I am a\r\nbeast by nature!”\r\n\r\n“Rather!” assented the innkeeper yawning. Marmeladov struck his fist\r\nresolutely on the table.\r\n\r\n“Such is my fate! Do you know, sir, do you know, I have sold her very\r\nstockings for drink? Not her shoes--that would be more or less in the\r\norder of things, but her stockings, her stockings I have sold for drink!\r\nHer mohair shawl I sold for drink, a present to her long ago, her own\r\nproperty, not mine; and we live in a cold room and she caught cold this\r\nwinter and has begun coughing and spitting blood too. We have three\r\nlittle children and Katerina Ivanovna is at work from morning till\r\nnight; she is scrubbing and cleaning and washing the children, for she’s\r\nbeen used to cleanliness from a child. But her chest is weak and she has\r\na tendency to consumption and I feel it! Do you suppose I don’t feel it?\r\nAnd the more I drink the more I feel it. That’s why I drink too. I try\r\nto find sympathy and feeling in drink.... I drink so that I may suffer\r\ntwice as much!” And as though in despair he laid his head down on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n“Young man,” he went on, raising his head again, “in your face I seem to\r\nread some trouble of mind. When you came in I read it, and that was why\r\nI addressed you at once. For in unfolding to you the story of my life, I\r\ndo not wish to make myself a laughing-stock before these idle listeners,\r\nwho indeed know all about it already, but I am looking for a man\r\nof feeling and education. Know then that my wife was educated in a\r\nhigh-class school for the daughters of noblemen, and on leaving she\r\ndanced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages for\r\nwhich she was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit.\r\nThe medal... well, the medal of course was sold--long ago, hm... but the\r\ncertificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she showed\r\nit to our landlady. And although she is most continually on bad terms\r\nwith the landlady, yet she wanted to tell someone or other of her past\r\nhonours and of the happy days that are gone. I don’t condemn her for\r\nit, I don’t blame her, for the one thing left her is recollection of\r\nthe past, and all the rest is dust and ashes. Yes, yes, she is a lady\r\nof spirit, proud and determined. She scrubs the floors herself and has\r\nnothing but black bread to eat, but won’t allow herself to be treated\r\nwith disrespect. That’s why she would not overlook Mr. Lebeziatnikov’s\r\nrudeness to her, and so when he gave her a beating for it, she took to\r\nher bed more from the hurt to her feelings than from the blows. She was\r\na widow when I married her, with three children, one smaller than the\r\nother. She married her first husband, an infantry officer, for love, and\r\nran away with him from her father’s house. She was exceedingly fond of\r\nher husband; but he gave way to cards, got into trouble and with that he\r\ndied. He used to beat her at the end: and although she paid him back, of\r\nwhich I have authentic documentary evidence, to this day she speaks of\r\nhim with tears and she throws him up to me; and I am glad, I am glad\r\nthat, though only in imagination, she should think of herself as having\r\nonce been happy.... And she was left at his death with three children in\r\na wild and remote district where I happened to be at the time; and she\r\nwas left in such hopeless poverty that, although I have seen many ups\r\nand downs of all sort, I don’t feel equal to describing it even. Her\r\nrelations had all thrown her off. And she was proud, too, excessively\r\nproud.... And then, honoured sir, and then, I, being at the time a\r\nwidower, with a daughter of fourteen left me by my first wife, offered\r\nher my hand, for I could not bear the sight of such suffering. You can\r\njudge the extremity of her calamities, that she, a woman of education\r\nand culture and distinguished family, should have consented to be my\r\nwife. But she did! Weeping and sobbing and wringing her hands, she\r\nmarried me! For she had nowhere to turn! Do you understand, sir, do you\r\nunderstand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn? No,\r\nthat you don’t understand yet.... And for a whole year, I performed\r\nmy duties conscientiously and faithfully, and did not touch this” (he\r\ntapped the jug with his finger), “for I have feelings. But even so, I\r\ncould not please her; and then I lost my place too, and that through no\r\nfault of mine but through changes in the office; and then I did touch\r\nit!... It will be a year and a half ago soon since we found ourselves at\r\nlast after many wanderings and numerous calamities in this magnificent\r\ncapital, adorned with innumerable monuments. Here I obtained a\r\nsituation.... I obtained it and I lost it again. Do you understand? This\r\ntime it was through my own fault I lost it: for my weakness had come\r\nout.... We have now part of a room at Amalia Fyodorovna Lippevechsel’s;\r\nand what we live upon and what we pay our rent with, I could not say.\r\nThere are a lot of people living there besides ourselves. Dirt and\r\ndisorder, a perfect Bedlam... hm... yes... And meanwhile my daughter by\r\nmy first wife has grown up; and what my daughter has had to put up with\r\nfrom her step-mother whilst she was growing up, I won’t speak of. For,\r\nthough Katerina Ivanovna is full of generous feelings, she is a spirited\r\nlady, irritable and short-tempered.... Yes. But it’s no use going over\r\nthat! Sonia, as you may well fancy, has had no education. I did make an\r\neffort four years ago to give her a course of geography and universal\r\nhistory, but as I was not very well up in those subjects myself and we\r\nhad no suitable books, and what books we had... hm, anyway we have not\r\neven those now, so all our instruction came to an end. We stopped at\r\nCyrus of Persia. Since she has attained years of maturity, she has read\r\nother books of romantic tendency and of late she had read with great\r\ninterest a book she got through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, Lewes’ Physiology--do\r\nyou know it?--and even recounted extracts from it to us: and that’s the\r\nwhole of her education. And now may I venture to address you, honoured\r\nsir, on my own account with a private question. Do you suppose that\r\na respectable poor girl can earn much by honest work? Not fifteen\r\nfarthings a day can she earn, if she is respectable and has no special\r\ntalent and that without putting her work down for an instant! And what’s\r\nmore, Ivan Ivanitch Klopstock the civil counsellor--have you heard of\r\nhim?--has not to this day paid her for the half-dozen linen shirts she\r\nmade him and drove her roughly away, stamping and reviling her, on the\r\npretext that the shirt collars were not made like the pattern and were\r\nput in askew. And there are the little ones hungry.... And Katerina\r\nIvanovna walking up and down and wringing her hands, her cheeks flushed\r\nred, as they always are in that disease: ‘Here you live with us,’ says\r\nshe, ‘you eat and drink and are kept warm and you do nothing to help.’\r\nAnd much she gets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the\r\nlittle ones for three days! I was lying at the time... well, what of\r\nit! I was lying drunk and I heard my Sonia speaking (she is a gentle\r\ncreature with a soft little voice... fair hair and such a pale, thin\r\nlittle face). She said: ‘Katerina Ivanovna, am I really to do a thing\r\nlike that?’ And Darya Frantsovna, a woman of evil character and very\r\nwell known to the police, had two or three times tried to get at her\r\nthrough the landlady. ‘And why not?’ said Katerina Ivanovna with a jeer,\r\n‘you are something mighty precious to be so careful of!’ But don’t blame\r\nher, don’t blame her, honoured sir, don’t blame her! She was not herself\r\nwhen she spoke, but driven to distraction by her illness and the crying\r\nof the hungry children; and it was said more to wound her than anything\r\nelse.... For that’s Katerina Ivanovna’s character, and when children\r\ncry, even from hunger, she falls to beating them at once. At six o’clock\r\nI saw Sonia get up, put on her kerchief and her cape, and go out of the\r\nroom and about nine o’clock she came back. She walked straight up to\r\nKaterina Ivanovna and she laid thirty roubles on the table before her\r\nin silence. She did not utter a word, she did not even look at her, she\r\nsimply picked up our big green _drap de dames_ shawl (we have a shawl,\r\nmade of _drap de dames_), put it over her head and face and lay down\r\non the bed with her face to the wall; only her little shoulders and her\r\nbody kept shuddering.... And I went on lying there, just as before....\r\nAnd then I saw, young man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna, in the same silence\r\ngo up to Sonia’s little bed; she was on her knees all the evening\r\nkissing Sonia’s feet, and would not get up, and then they both fell\r\nasleep in each other’s arms... together, together... yes... and I... lay\r\ndrunk.”\r\n\r\nMarmeladov stopped short, as though his voice had failed him. Then he\r\nhurriedly filled his glass, drank, and cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n“Since then, sir,” he went on after a brief pause--“Since then, owing\r\nto an unfortunate occurrence and through information given by\r\nevil-intentioned persons--in all which Darya Frantsovna took a\r\nleading part on the pretext that she had been treated with want of\r\nrespect--since then my daughter Sofya Semyonovna has been forced to take\r\na yellow ticket, and owing to that she is unable to go on living with\r\nus. For our landlady, Amalia Fyodorovna would not hear of it (though\r\nshe had backed up Darya Frantsovna before) and Mr. Lebeziatnikov too...\r\nhm.... All the trouble between him and Katerina Ivanovna was on Sonia’s\r\naccount. At first he was for making up to Sonia himself and then all of\r\na sudden he stood on his dignity: ‘how,’ said he, ‘can a highly educated\r\nman like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that?’ And Katerina\r\nIvanovna would not let it pass, she stood up for her... and so that’s\r\nhow it happened. And Sonia comes to us now, mostly after dark; she\r\ncomforts Katerina Ivanovna and gives her all she can.... She has a room\r\nat the Kapernaumovs’ the tailors, she lodges with them; Kapernaumov is\r\na lame man with a cleft palate and all of his numerous family have cleft\r\npalates too. And his wife, too, has a cleft palate. They all live in one\r\nroom, but Sonia has her own, partitioned off.... Hm... yes... very poor\r\npeople and all with cleft palates... yes. Then I got up in the morning,\r\nand put on my rags, lifted up my hands to heaven and set off to his\r\nexcellency Ivan Afanasyvitch. His excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch, do you\r\nknow him? No? Well, then, it’s a man of God you don’t know. He is wax...\r\nwax before the face of the Lord; even as wax melteth!... His eyes were\r\ndim when he heard my story. ‘Marmeladov, once already you have\r\ndeceived my expectations... I’ll take you once more on my own\r\nresponsibility’--that’s what he said, ‘remember,’ he said, ‘and now you\r\ncan go.’ I kissed the dust at his feet--in thought only, for in reality\r\nhe would not have allowed me to do it, being a statesman and a man of\r\nmodern political and enlightened ideas. I returned home, and when I\r\nannounced that I’d been taken back into the service and should receive a\r\nsalary, heavens, what a to-do there was!...”\r\n\r\nMarmeladov stopped again in violent excitement. At that moment a whole\r\nparty of revellers already drunk came in from the street, and the sounds\r\nof a hired concertina and the cracked piping voice of a child of seven\r\nsinging “The Hamlet” were heard in the entry. The room was filled with\r\nnoise. The tavern-keeper and the boys were busy with the new-comers.\r\nMarmeladov paying no attention to the new arrivals continued his story.\r\nHe appeared by now to be extremely weak, but as he became more and more\r\ndrunk, he became more and more talkative. The recollection of his\r\nrecent success in getting the situation seemed to revive him, and was\r\npositively reflected in a sort of radiance on his face. Raskolnikov\r\nlistened attentively.\r\n\r\n“That was five weeks ago, sir. Yes.... As soon as Katerina Ivanovna\r\nand Sonia heard of it, mercy on us, it was as though I stepped into the\r\nkingdom of Heaven. It used to be: you can lie like a beast, nothing but\r\nabuse. Now they were walking on tiptoe, hushing the children. ‘Semyon\r\nZaharovitch is tired with his work at the office, he is resting, shh!’\r\nThey made me coffee before I went to work and boiled cream for me! They\r\nbegan to get real cream for me, do you hear that? And how they managed\r\nto get together the money for a decent outfit--eleven roubles, fifty\r\ncopecks, I can’t guess. Boots, cotton shirt-fronts--most magnificent,\r\na uniform, they got up all in splendid style, for eleven roubles and\r\na half. The first morning I came back from the office I found Katerina\r\nIvanovna had cooked two courses for dinner--soup and salt meat with\r\nhorse radish--which we had never dreamed of till then. She had not any\r\ndresses... none at all, but she got herself up as though she were going\r\non a visit; and not that she’d anything to do it with, she smartened\r\nherself up with nothing at all, she’d done her hair nicely, put on a\r\nclean collar of some sort, cuffs, and there she was, quite a different\r\nperson, she was younger and better looking. Sonia, my little darling,\r\nhad only helped with money ‘for the time,’ she said, ‘it won’t do for me\r\nto come and see you too often. After dark maybe when no one can see.’ Do\r\nyou hear, do you hear? I lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you\r\nthink: though Katerina Ivanovna had quarrelled to the last degree with\r\nour landlady Amalia Fyodorovna only a week before, she could not\r\nresist then asking her in to coffee. For two hours they were sitting,\r\nwhispering together. ‘Semyon Zaharovitch is in the service again,\r\nnow, and receiving a salary,’ says she, ‘and he went himself to his\r\nexcellency and his excellency himself came out to him, made all the\r\nothers wait and led Semyon Zaharovitch by the hand before everybody into\r\nhis study.’ Do you hear, do you hear? ‘To be sure,’ says he, ‘Semyon\r\nZaharovitch, remembering your past services,’ says he, ‘and in spite\r\nof your propensity to that foolish weakness, since you promise now and\r\nsince moreover we’ve got on badly without you,’ (do you hear, do you\r\nhear;) ‘and so,’ says he, ‘I rely now on your word as a gentleman.’ And\r\nall that, let me tell you, she has simply made up for herself, and not\r\nsimply out of wantonness, for the sake of bragging; no, she believes it\r\nall herself, she amuses herself with her own fancies, upon my word she\r\ndoes! And I don’t blame her for it, no, I don’t blame her!... Six days\r\nago when I brought her my first earnings in full--twenty-three roubles\r\nforty copecks altogether--she called me her poppet: ‘poppet,’ said she,\r\n‘my little poppet.’ And when we were by ourselves, you understand?\r\nYou would not think me a beauty, you would not think much of me as a\r\nhusband, would you?... Well, she pinched my cheek, ‘my little poppet,’\r\nsaid she.”\r\n\r\nMarmeladov broke off, tried to smile, but suddenly his chin began\r\nto twitch. He controlled himself however. The tavern, the degraded\r\nappearance of the man, the five nights in the hay barge, and the pot of\r\nspirits, and yet this poignant love for his wife and children bewildered\r\nhis listener. Raskolnikov listened intently but with a sick sensation.\r\nHe felt vexed that he had come here.\r\n\r\n“Honoured sir, honoured sir,” cried Marmeladov recovering himself--“Oh,\r\nsir, perhaps all this seems a laughing matter to you, as it does to\r\nothers, and perhaps I am only worrying you with the stupidity of all the\r\ntrivial details of my home life, but it is not a laughing matter to me.\r\nFor I can feel it all.... And the whole of that heavenly day of my life\r\nand the whole of that evening I passed in fleeting dreams of how I would\r\narrange it all, and how I would dress all the children, and how I should\r\ngive her rest, and how I should rescue my own daughter from dishonour\r\nand restore her to the bosom of her family.... And a great deal more....\r\nQuite excusable, sir. Well, then, sir” (Marmeladov suddenly gave a sort\r\nof start, raised his head and gazed intently at his listener) “well, on\r\nthe very next day after all those dreams, that is to say, exactly five\r\ndays ago, in the evening, by a cunning trick, like a thief in the night,\r\nI stole from Katerina Ivanovna the key of her box, took out what was\r\nleft of my earnings, how much it was I have forgotten, and now look\r\nat me, all of you! It’s the fifth day since I left home, and they are\r\nlooking for me there and it’s the end of my employment, and my uniform\r\nis lying in a tavern on the Egyptian bridge. I exchanged it for the\r\ngarments I have on... and it’s the end of everything!”\r\n\r\nMarmeladov struck his forehead with his fist, clenched his teeth, closed\r\nhis eyes and leaned heavily with his elbow on the table. But a minute\r\nlater his face suddenly changed and with a certain assumed slyness and\r\naffectation of bravado, he glanced at Raskolnikov, laughed and said:\r\n\r\n“This morning I went to see Sonia, I went to ask her for a pick-me-up!\r\nHe-he-he!”\r\n\r\n“You don’t say she gave it to you?” cried one of the new-comers; he\r\nshouted the words and went off into a guffaw.\r\n\r\n“This very quart was bought with her money,” Marmeladov declared,\r\naddressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov. “Thirty copecks she gave\r\nme with her own hands, her last, all she had, as I saw.... She said\r\nnothing, she only looked at me without a word.... Not on earth, but up\r\nyonder... they grieve over men, they weep, but they don’t blame them,\r\nthey don’t blame them! But it hurts more, it hurts more when they don’t\r\nblame! Thirty copecks yes! And maybe she needs them now, eh? What do\r\nyou think, my dear sir? For now she’s got to keep up her appearance. It\r\ncosts money, that smartness, that special smartness, you know? Do you\r\nunderstand? And there’s pomatum, too, you see, she must have things;\r\npetticoats, starched ones, shoes, too, real jaunty ones to show off her\r\nfoot when she has to step over a puddle. Do you understand, sir, do you\r\nunderstand what all that smartness means? And here I, her own father,\r\nhere I took thirty copecks of that money for a drink! And I am drinking\r\nit! And I have already drunk it! Come, who will have pity on a man like\r\nme, eh? Are you sorry for me, sir, or not? Tell me, sir, are you sorry\r\nor not? He-he-he!”\r\n\r\nHe would have filled his glass, but there was no drink left. The pot was\r\nempty.\r\n\r\n“What are you to be pitied for?” shouted the tavern-keeper who was again\r\nnear them.\r\n\r\nShouts of laughter and even oaths followed. The laughter and the oaths\r\ncame from those who were listening and also from those who had heard\r\nnothing but were simply looking at the figure of the discharged\r\ngovernment clerk.\r\n\r\n“To be pitied! Why am I to be pitied?” Marmeladov suddenly declaimed,\r\nstanding up with his arm outstretched, as though he had been only\r\nwaiting for that question.\r\n\r\n“Why am I to be pitied, you say? Yes! there’s nothing to pity me for! I\r\nought to be crucified, crucified on a cross, not pitied! Crucify me,\r\noh judge, crucify me but pity me! And then I will go of myself to be\r\ncrucified, for it’s not merry-making I seek but tears and tribulation!...\r\nDo you suppose, you that sell, that this pint of yours has been\r\nsweet to me? It was tribulation I sought at the bottom of it, tears and\r\ntribulation, and have found it, and I have tasted it; but He will pity\r\nus Who has had pity on all men, Who has understood all men and all\r\nthings, He is the One, He too is the judge. He will come in that day\r\nand He will ask: ‘Where is the daughter who gave herself for her cross,\r\nconsumptive step-mother and for the little children of another? Where is\r\nthe daughter who had pity upon the filthy drunkard, her earthly father,\r\nundismayed by his beastliness?’ And He will say, ‘Come to me! I have\r\nalready forgiven thee once.... I have forgiven thee once.... Thy sins\r\nwhich are many are forgiven thee for thou hast loved much....’ And he\r\nwill forgive my Sonia, He will forgive, I know it... I felt it in my\r\nheart when I was with her just now! And He will judge and will forgive\r\nall, the good and the evil, the wise and the meek.... And when He has\r\ndone with all of them, then He will summon us. ‘You too come forth,’\r\nHe will say, ‘Come forth ye drunkards, come forth, ye weak ones, come\r\nforth, ye children of shame!’ And we shall all come forth, without shame\r\nand shall stand before him. And He will say unto us, ‘Ye are swine, made\r\nin the Image of the Beast and with his mark; but come ye also!’ And the\r\nwise ones and those of understanding will say, ‘Oh Lord, why dost Thou\r\nreceive these men?’ And He will say, ‘This is why I receive them, oh ye\r\nwise, this is why I receive them, oh ye of understanding, that not one\r\nof them believed himself to be worthy of this.’ And He will hold out His\r\nhands to us and we shall fall down before him... and we shall weep...\r\nand we shall understand all things! Then we shall understand all!... and\r\nall will understand, Katerina Ivanovna even... she will understand....\r\nLord, Thy kingdom come!” And he sank down on the bench exhausted, and\r\nhelpless, looking at no one, apparently oblivious of his surroundings\r\nand plunged in deep thought. His words had created a certain impression;\r\nthere was a moment of silence; but soon laughter and oaths were heard\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“That’s his notion!”\r\n\r\n“Talked himself silly!”\r\n\r\n“A fine clerk he is!”\r\n\r\nAnd so on, and so on.\r\n\r\n“Let us go, sir,” said Marmeladov all at once, raising his head and\r\naddressing Raskolnikov--“come along with me... Kozel’s house, looking\r\ninto the yard. I’m going to Katerina Ivanovna--time I did.”\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov had for some time been wanting to go and he had meant to\r\nhelp him. Marmeladov was much unsteadier on his legs than in his speech\r\nand leaned heavily on the young man. They had two or three hundred\r\npaces to go. The drunken man was more and more overcome by dismay and\r\nconfusion as they drew nearer the house.\r\n\r\n“It’s not Katerina Ivanovna I am afraid of now,” he muttered in\r\nagitation--“and that she will begin pulling my hair. What does my hair\r\nmatter! Bother my hair! That’s what I say! Indeed it will be better if\r\nshe does begin pulling it, that’s not what I am afraid of... it’s her\r\neyes I am afraid of... yes, her eyes... the red on her cheeks, too,\r\nfrightens me... and her breathing too.... Have you noticed how people\r\nin that disease breathe... when they are excited? I am frightened of\r\nthe children’s crying, too.... For if Sonia has not taken them food...\r\nI don’t know what’s happened! I don’t know! But blows I am not afraid\r\nof.... Know, sir, that such blows are not a pain to me, but even an\r\nenjoyment. In fact I can’t get on without it.... It’s better so. Let\r\nher strike me, it relieves her heart... it’s better so... There is the\r\nhouse. The house of Kozel, the cabinet-maker... a German, well-to-do.\r\nLead the way!”\r\n\r\nThey went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey. The staircase\r\ngot darker and darker as they went up. It was nearly eleven o’clock\r\nand although in summer in Petersburg there is no real night, yet it was\r\nquite dark at the top of the stairs.\r\n\r\nA grimy little door at the very top of the stairs stood ajar. A very\r\npoor-looking room about ten paces long was lighted up by a candle-end;\r\nthe whole of it was visible from the entrance. It was all in disorder,\r\nlittered up with rags of all sorts, especially children’s garments.\r\nAcross the furthest corner was stretched a ragged sheet. Behind it\r\nprobably was the bed. There was nothing in the room except two chairs\r\nand a sofa covered with American leather, full of holes, before which\r\nstood an old deal kitchen-table, unpainted and uncovered. At the edge\r\nof the table stood a smoldering tallow-candle in an iron candlestick. It\r\nappeared that the family had a room to themselves, not part of a room,\r\nbut their room was practically a passage. The door leading to the other\r\nrooms, or rather cupboards, into which Amalia Lippevechsel’s flat was\r\ndivided stood half open, and there was shouting, uproar and laughter\r\nwithin. People seemed to be playing cards and drinking tea there. Words\r\nof the most unceremonious kind flew out from time to time.\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov recognised Katerina Ivanovna at once. She was a rather tall,\r\nslim and graceful woman, terribly emaciated, with magnificent dark brown\r\nhair and with a hectic flush in her cheeks. She was pacing up and down\r\nin her little room, pressing her hands against her chest; her lips\r\nwere parched and her breathing came in nervous broken gasps. Her eyes\r\nglittered as in fever and looked about with a harsh immovable stare. And\r\nthat consumptive and excited face with the last flickering light of the\r\ncandle-end playing upon it made a sickening impression. She seemed to\r\nRaskolnikov about thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife for\r\nMarmeladov.... She had not heard them and did not notice them coming in.\r\nShe seemed to be lost in thought, hearing and seeing nothing. The room\r\nwas close, but she had not opened the window; a stench rose from the\r\nstaircase, but the door on to the stairs was not closed. From the inner\r\nrooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in, she kept coughing, but did not\r\nclose the door. The youngest child, a girl of six, was asleep, sitting\r\ncurled up on the floor with her head on the sofa. A boy a year older\r\nstood crying and shaking in the corner, probably he had just had a\r\nbeating. Beside him stood a girl of nine years old, tall and thin,\r\nwearing a thin and ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flung\r\nover her bare shoulders, long outgrown and barely reaching her knees.\r\nHer arm, as thin as a stick, was round her brother’s neck. She was\r\ntrying to comfort him, whispering something to him, and doing all she\r\ncould to keep him from whimpering again. At the same time her large\r\ndark eyes, which looked larger still from the thinness of her frightened\r\nface, were watching her mother with alarm. Marmeladov did not enter the\r\ndoor, but dropped on his knees in the very doorway, pushing Raskolnikov\r\nin front of him. The woman seeing a stranger stopped indifferently\r\nfacing him, coming to herself for a moment and apparently wondering what\r\nhe had come for. But evidently she decided that he was going into\r\nthe next room, as he had to pass through hers to get there. Taking no\r\nfurther notice of him, she walked towards the outer door to close it\r\nand uttered a sudden scream on seeing her husband on his knees in the\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” she cried out in a frenzy, “he has come back! The criminal! the\r\nmonster!... And where is the money? What’s in your pocket, show me! And\r\nyour clothes are all different! Where are your clothes? Where is the\r\nmoney! Speak!”\r\n\r\nAnd she fell to searching him. Marmeladov submissively and obediently\r\nheld up both arms to facilitate the search. Not a farthing was there.\r\n\r\n“Where is the money?” she cried--“Mercy on us, can he have drunk it all?\r\nThere were twelve silver roubles left in the chest!” and in a fury\r\nshe seized him by the hair and dragged him into the room. Marmeladov\r\nseconded her efforts by meekly crawling along on his knees.\r\n\r\n“And this is a consolation to me! This does not hurt me, but is a\r\npositive con-so-la-tion, ho-nou-red sir,” he called out, shaken to and\r\nfro by his hair and even once striking the ground with his forehead.\r\nThe child asleep on the floor woke up, and began to cry. The boy in the\r\ncorner losing all control began trembling and screaming and rushed\r\nto his sister in violent terror, almost in a fit. The eldest girl was\r\nshaking like a leaf.\r\n\r\n“He’s drunk it! he’s drunk it all,” the poor woman screamed in\r\ndespair--“and his clothes are gone! And they are hungry, hungry!”--and\r\nwringing her hands she pointed to the children. “Oh, accursed life!\r\nAnd you, are you not ashamed?”--she pounced all at once upon\r\nRaskolnikov--“from the tavern! Have you been drinking with him? You have\r\nbeen drinking with him, too! Go away!”\r\n\r\nThe young man was hastening away without uttering a word. The inner door\r\nwas thrown wide open and inquisitive faces were peering in at it. Coarse\r\nlaughing faces with pipes and cigarettes and heads wearing caps thrust\r\nthemselves in at the doorway. Further in could be seen figures in\r\ndressing gowns flung open, in costumes of unseemly scantiness, some of\r\nthem with cards in their hands. They were particularly diverted, when\r\nMarmeladov, dragged about by his hair, shouted that it was a consolation\r\nto him. They even began to come into the room; at last a sinister shrill\r\noutcry was heard: this came from Amalia Lippevechsel herself pushing her\r\nway amongst them and trying to restore order after her own fashion and\r\nfor the hundredth time to frighten the poor woman by ordering her\r\nwith coarse abuse to clear out of the room next day. As he went out,\r\nRaskolnikov had time to put his hand into his pocket, to snatch up the\r\ncoppers he had received in exchange for his rouble in the tavern and to\r\nlay them unnoticed on the window. Afterwards on the stairs, he changed\r\nhis mind and would have gone back.\r\n\r\n“What a stupid thing I’ve done,” he thought to himself, “they have Sonia\r\nand I want it myself.” But reflecting that it would be impossible to\r\ntake it back now and that in any case he would not have taken it, he\r\ndismissed it with a wave of his hand and went back to his lodging.\r\n“Sonia wants pomatum too,” he said as he walked along the street, and he\r\nlaughed malignantly--“such smartness costs money.... Hm! And maybe Sonia\r\nherself will be bankrupt to-day, for there is always a risk, hunting\r\nbig game... digging for gold... then they would all be without a crust\r\nto-morrow except for my money. Hurrah for Sonia! What a mine they’ve dug\r\nthere! And they’re making the most of it! Yes, they are making the most\r\nof it! They’ve wept over it and grown used to it. Man grows used to\r\neverything, the scoundrel!”\r\n\r\nHe sank into thought.\r\n\r\n“And what if I am wrong,” he cried suddenly after a moment’s thought.\r\n“What if man is not really a scoundrel, man in general, I mean, the\r\nwhole race of mankind--then all the rest is prejudice, simply artificial\r\nterrors and there are no barriers and it’s all as it should be.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nHe waked up late next day after a broken sleep. But his sleep had not\r\nrefreshed him; he waked up bilious, irritable, ill-tempered, and looked\r\nwith hatred at his room. It was a tiny cupboard of a room about six\r\npaces in length. It had a poverty-stricken appearance with its dusty\r\nyellow paper peeling off the walls, and it was so low-pitched that a man\r\nof more than average height was ill at ease in it and felt every moment\r\nthat he would knock his head against the ceiling. The furniture was in\r\nkeeping with the room: there were three old chairs, rather rickety; a\r\npainted table in the corner on which lay a few manuscripts and books;\r\nthe dust that lay thick upon them showed that they had been long\r\nuntouched. A big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole of one wall and\r\nhalf the floor space of the room; it was once covered with chintz, but\r\nwas now in rags and served Raskolnikov as a bed. Often he went to sleep\r\non it, as he was, without undressing, without sheets, wrapped in his old\r\nstudent’s overcoat, with his head on one little pillow, under which he\r\nheaped up all the linen he had, clean and dirty, by way of a bolster. A\r\nlittle table stood in front of the sofa.\r\n\r\nIt would have been difficult to sink to a lower ebb of disorder, but to\r\nRaskolnikov in his present state of mind this was positively agreeable.\r\nHe had got completely away from everyone, like a tortoise in its shell,\r\nand even the sight of a servant girl who had to wait upon him and looked\r\nsometimes into his room made him writhe with nervous irritation. He was\r\nin the condition that overtakes some monomaniacs entirely concentrated\r\nupon one thing. His landlady had for the last fortnight given up sending\r\nhim in meals, and he had not yet thought of expostulating with her,\r\nthough he went without his dinner. Nastasya, the cook and only servant,\r\nwas rather pleased at the lodger’s mood and had entirely given up\r\nsweeping and doing his room, only once a week or so she would stray into\r\nhis room with a broom. She waked him up that day.\r\n\r\n“Get up, why are you asleep?” she called to him. “It’s past nine, I have\r\nbrought you some tea; will you have a cup? I should think you’re fairly\r\nstarving?”\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov opened his eyes, started and recognised Nastasya.\r\n\r\n“From the landlady, eh?” he asked, slowly and with a sickly face sitting\r\nup on the sofa.\r\n\r\n“From the landlady, indeed!”\r\n\r\nShe set before him her own cracked teapot full of weak and stale tea and\r\nlaid two yellow lumps of sugar by the side of it.\r\n\r\n“Here, Nastasya, take it please,” he said, fumbling in his pocket (for\r\nhe had slept in his clothes) and taking out a handful of coppers--“run\r\nand buy me a loaf. And get me a little sausage, the cheapest, at the\r\npork-butcher’s.”\r\n\r\n“The loaf I’ll fetch you this very minute, but wouldn’t you rather have\r\nsome cabbage soup instead of sausage? It’s capital soup, yesterday’s. I\r\nsaved it for you yesterday, but you came in late. It’s fine soup.”\r\n\r\nWhen the soup had been brought, and he had begun upon it, Nastasya\r\nsat down beside him on the sofa and began chatting. She was a country\r\npeasant-woman and a very talkative one.\r\n\r\n“Praskovya Pavlovna means to complain to the police about you,” she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHe scowled.\r\n\r\n“To the police? What does she want?”\r\n\r\n“You don’t pay her money and you won’t turn out of the room. That’s what\r\nshe wants, to be sure.”\r\n\r\n“The devil, that’s the last straw,” he muttered, grinding his teeth,\r\n“no, that would not suit me... just now. She is a fool,” he added aloud.\r\n“I’ll go and talk to her to-day.”\r\n\r\n“Fool she is and no mistake, just as I am. But why, if you are so\r\nclever, do you lie here like a sack and have nothing to show for it? One\r\ntime you used to go out, you say, to teach children. But why is it you\r\ndo nothing now?”\r\n\r\n“I am doing...” Raskolnikov began sullenly and reluctantly.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing?”\r\n\r\n“Work...”\r\n\r\n“What sort of work?”\r\n\r\n“I am thinking,” he answered seriously after a pause.\r\n\r\nNastasya was overcome with a fit of laughter. She was given to laughter\r\nand when anything amused her, she laughed inaudibly, quivering and\r\nshaking all over till she felt ill.\r\n\r\n“And have you made much money by your thinking?” she managed to\r\narticulate at last.\r\n\r\n“One can’t go out to give lessons without boots. And I’m sick of it.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t quarrel with your bread and butter.”\r\n\r\n“They pay so little for lessons. What’s the use of a few coppers?” he\r\nanswered, reluctantly, as though replying to his own thought.\r\n\r\n“And you want to get a fortune all at once?”\r\n\r\nHe looked at her strangely.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I want a fortune,” he answered firmly, after a brief pause.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be in such a hurry, you quite frighten me! Shall I get you the\r\nloaf or not?”\r\n\r\n“As you please.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, I forgot! A letter came for you yesterday when you were out.”\r\n\r\n“A letter? for me! from whom?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t say. I gave three copecks of my own to the postman for it. Will\r\nyou pay me back?”\r\n\r\n“Then bring it to me, for God’s sake, bring it,” cried Raskolnikov\r\ngreatly excited--“good God!”\r\n\r\nA minute later the letter was brought him. That was it: from his mother,\r\nfrom the province of R----. He turned pale when he took it. It was a\r\nlong while since he had received a letter, but another feeling also\r\nsuddenly stabbed his heart.\r\n\r\n“Nastasya, leave me alone, for goodness’ sake; here are your three\r\ncopecks, but for goodness’ sake, make haste and go!”\r\n\r\nThe letter was quivering in his hand; he did not want to open it in her\r\npresence; he wanted to be left _alone_ with this letter. When Nastasya\r\nhad gone out, he lifted it quickly to his lips and kissed it; then he\r\ngazed intently at the address, the small, sloping handwriting, so dear\r\nand familiar, of the mother who had once taught him to read and write.\r\nHe delayed; he seemed almost afraid of something. At last he opened it;\r\nit was a thick heavy letter, weighing over two ounces, two large sheets\r\nof note paper were covered with very small handwriting.\r\n\r\n“My dear Rodya,” wrote his mother--“it’s two months since I last had a\r\ntalk with you by letter which has distressed me and even kept me\r\nawake at night, thinking. But I am sure you will not blame me for my\r\ninevitable silence. You know how I love you; you are all we have to look\r\nto, Dounia and I, you are our all, our one hope, our one stay. What a\r\ngrief it was to me when I heard that you had given up the university\r\nsome months ago, for want of means to keep yourself and that you had\r\nlost your lessons and your other work! How could I help you out of my\r\nhundred and twenty roubles a year pension? The fifteen roubles I sent\r\nyou four months ago I borrowed, as you know, on security of my pension,\r\nfrom Vassily Ivanovitch Vahrushin a merchant of this town. He is a\r\nkind-hearted man and was a friend of your father’s too. But having given\r\nhim the right to receive the pension, I had to wait till the debt was\r\npaid off and that is only just done, so that I’ve been unable to send\r\nyou anything all this time. But now, thank God, I believe I shall\r\nbe able to send you something more and in fact we may congratulate\r\nourselves on our good fortune now, of which I hasten to inform you. In\r\nthe first place, would you have guessed, dear Rodya, that your sister\r\nhas been living with me for the last six weeks and we shall not be\r\nseparated in the future. Thank God, her sufferings are over, but I will\r\ntell you everything in order, so that you may know just how everything\r\nhas happened and all that we have hitherto concealed from you. When you\r\nwrote to me two months ago that you had heard that Dounia had a great\r\ndeal to put up with in the Svidrigaïlovs’ house, when you wrote that\r\nand asked me to tell you all about it--what could I write in answer to\r\nyou? If I had written the whole truth to you, I dare say you would have\r\nthrown up everything and have come to us, even if you had to walk all\r\nthe way, for I know your character and your feelings, and you would not\r\nlet your sister be insulted. I was in despair myself, but what could I\r\ndo? And, besides, I did not know the whole truth myself then. What\r\nmade it all so difficult was that Dounia received a hundred roubles\r\nin advance when she took the place as governess in their family, on\r\ncondition of part of her salary being deducted every month, and so it\r\nwas impossible to throw up the situation without repaying the debt.\r\nThis sum (now I can explain it all to you, my precious Rodya) she took\r\nchiefly in order to send you sixty roubles, which you needed so terribly\r\nthen and which you received from us last year. We deceived you then,\r\nwriting that this money came from Dounia’s savings, but that was not\r\nso, and now I tell you all about it, because, thank God, things have\r\nsuddenly changed for the better, and that you may know how Dounia loves\r\nyou and what a heart she has. At first indeed Mr. Svidrigaïlov treated\r\nher very rudely and used to make disrespectful and jeering remarks at\r\ntable.... But I don’t want to go into all those painful details, so as\r\nnot to worry you for nothing when it is now all over. In short, in spite\r\nof the kind and generous behaviour of Marfa Petrovna, Mr. Svidrigaïlov’s\r\nwife, and all the rest of the household, Dounia had a very hard time,\r\nespecially when Mr. Svidrigaïlov, relapsing into his old regimental\r\nhabits, was under the influence of Bacchus. And how do you think it\r\nwas all explained later on? Would you believe that the crazy fellow had\r\nconceived a passion for Dounia from the beginning, but had concealed\r\nit under a show of rudeness and contempt. Possibly he was ashamed and\r\nhorrified himself at his own flighty hopes, considering his years and\r\nhis being the father of a family; and that made him angry with Dounia.\r\nAnd possibly, too, he hoped by his rude and sneering behaviour to hide\r\nthe truth from others. But at last he lost all control and had the face\r\nto make Dounia an open and shameful proposal, promising her all sorts of\r\ninducements and offering, besides, to throw up everything and take her\r\nto another estate of his, or even abroad. You can imagine all she went\r\nthrough! To leave her situation at once was impossible not only on\r\naccount of the money debt, but also to spare the feelings of Marfa\r\nPetrovna, whose suspicions would have been aroused: and then Dounia\r\nwould have been the cause of a rupture in the family. And it would\r\nhave meant a terrible scandal for Dounia too; that would have been\r\ninevitable. There were various other reasons owing to which Dounia could\r\nnot hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks. You know\r\nDounia, of course; you know how clever she is and what a strong will she\r\nhas. Dounia can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult cases\r\nshe has the fortitude to maintain her firmness. She did not even write\r\nto me about everything for fear of upsetting me, although we were\r\nconstantly in communication. It all ended very unexpectedly. Marfa\r\nPetrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring Dounia in the\r\ngarden, and, putting quite a wrong interpretation on the position, threw\r\nthe blame upon her, believing her to be the cause of it all. An awful\r\nscene took place between them on the spot in the garden; Marfa Petrovna\r\nwent so far as to strike Dounia, refused to hear anything and was\r\nshouting at her for a whole hour and then gave orders that Dounia should\r\nbe packed off at once to me in a plain peasant’s cart, into which they\r\nflung all her things, her linen and her clothes, all pell-mell, without\r\nfolding it up and packing it. And a heavy shower of rain came on, too,\r\nand Dounia, insulted and put to shame, had to drive with a peasant in an\r\nopen cart all the seventeen versts into town. Only think now what answer\r\ncould I have sent to the letter I received from you two months ago and\r\nwhat could I have written? I was in despair; I dared not write to\r\nyou the truth because you would have been very unhappy, mortified\r\nand indignant, and yet what could you do? You could only perhaps ruin\r\nyourself, and, besides, Dounia would not allow it; and fill up my letter\r\nwith trifles when my heart was so full of sorrow, I could not. For a\r\nwhole month the town was full of gossip about this scandal, and it came\r\nto such a pass that Dounia and I dared not even go to church on account\r\nof the contemptuous looks, whispers, and even remarks made aloud about\r\nus. All our acquaintances avoided us, nobody even bowed to us in the\r\nstreet, and I learnt that some shopmen and clerks were intending to\r\ninsult us in a shameful way, smearing the gates of our house with pitch,\r\nso that the landlord began to tell us we must leave. All this was set\r\ngoing by Marfa Petrovna who managed to slander Dounia and throw dirt at\r\nher in every family. She knows everyone in the neighbourhood, and that\r\nmonth she was continually coming into the town, and as she is\r\nrather talkative and fond of gossiping about her family affairs and\r\nparticularly of complaining to all and each of her husband--which is not\r\nat all right--so in a short time she had spread her story not only in\r\nthe town, but over the whole surrounding district. It made me ill, but\r\nDounia bore it better than I did, and if only you could have seen how\r\nshe endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up! She is\r\nan angel! But by God’s mercy, our sufferings were cut short: Mr.\r\nSvidrigaïlov returned to his senses and repented and, probably\r\nfeeling sorry for Dounia, he laid before Marfa Petrovna a complete and\r\nunmistakable proof of Dounia’s innocence, in the form of a letter Dounia\r\nhad been forced to write and give to him, before Marfa Petrovna\r\ncame upon them in the garden. This letter, which remained in Mr.\r\nSvidrigaïlov’s hands after her departure, she had written to refuse\r\npersonal explanations and secret interviews, for which he was entreating\r\nher. In that letter she reproached him with great heat and indignation\r\nfor the baseness of his behaviour in regard to Marfa Petrovna, reminding\r\nhim that he was the father and head of a family and telling him how\r\ninfamous it was of him to torment and make unhappy a defenceless girl,\r\nunhappy enough already. Indeed, dear Rodya, the letter was so nobly and\r\ntouchingly written that I sobbed when I read it and to this day I cannot\r\nread it without tears. Moreover, the evidence of the servants, too,\r\ncleared Dounia’s reputation; they had seen and known a great deal more\r\nthan Mr. Svidrigaïlov had himself supposed--as indeed is always the case\r\nwith servants. Marfa Petrovna was completely taken aback, and ‘again\r\ncrushed’ as she said herself to us, but she was completely convinced of\r\nDounia’s innocence. The very next day, being Sunday, she went straight\r\nto the Cathedral, knelt down and prayed with tears to Our Lady to give\r\nher strength to bear this new trial and to do her duty. Then she\r\ncame straight from the Cathedral to us, told us the whole story, wept\r\nbitterly and, fully penitent, she embraced Dounia and besought her to\r\nforgive her. The same morning without any delay, she went round to all\r\nthe houses in the town and everywhere, shedding tears, she asserted in\r\nthe most flattering terms Dounia’s innocence and the nobility of\r\nher feelings and her behavior. What was more, she showed and read to\r\neveryone the letter in Dounia’s own handwriting to Mr. Svidrigaïlov and\r\neven allowed them to take copies of it--which I must say I think was\r\nsuperfluous. In this way she was busy for several days in driving about\r\nthe whole town, because some people had taken offence through precedence\r\nhaving been given to others. And therefore they had to take turns, so\r\nthat in every house she was expected before she arrived, and everyone\r\nknew that on such and such a day Marfa Petrovna would be reading the\r\nletter in such and such a place and people assembled for every reading\r\nof it, even many who had heard it several times already both in their\r\nown houses and in other people’s. In my opinion a great deal, a very\r\ngreat deal of all this was unnecessary; but that’s Marfa Petrovna’s\r\ncharacter. Anyway she succeeded in completely re-establishing Dounia’s\r\nreputation and the whole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelible\r\ndisgrace upon her husband, as the only person to blame, so that I really\r\nbegan to feel sorry for him; it was really treating the crazy fellow too\r\nharshly. Dounia was at once asked to give lessons in several families,\r\nbut she refused. All of a sudden everyone began to treat her with marked\r\nrespect and all this did much to bring about the event by which, one may\r\nsay, our whole fortunes are now transformed. You must know, dear Rodya,\r\nthat Dounia has a suitor and that she has already consented to marry\r\nhim. I hasten to tell you all about the matter, and though it has been\r\narranged without asking your consent, I think you will not be aggrieved\r\nwith me or with your sister on that account, for you will see that we\r\ncould not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you. And you\r\ncould not have judged all the facts without being on the spot. This\r\nwas how it happened. He is already of the rank of a counsellor, Pyotr\r\nPetrovitch Luzhin, and is distantly related to Marfa Petrovna, who\r\nhas been very active in bringing the match about. It began with his\r\nexpressing through her his desire to make our acquaintance. He was\r\nproperly received, drank coffee with us and the very next day he sent\r\nus a letter in which he very courteously made an offer and begged for a\r\nspeedy and decided answer. He is a very busy man and is in a great hurry\r\nto get to Petersburg, so that every moment is precious to him. At first,\r\nof course, we were greatly surprised, as it had all happened so quickly\r\nand unexpectedly. We thought and talked it over the whole day. He is a\r\nwell-to-do man, to be depended upon, he has two posts in the government\r\nand has already made his fortune. It is true that he is forty-five years\r\nold, but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be\r\nthought attractive by women, and he is altogether a very respectable and\r\npresentable man, only he seems a little morose and somewhat conceited.\r\nBut possibly that may only be the impression he makes at first sight.\r\nAnd beware, dear Rodya, when he comes to Petersburg, as he shortly will\r\ndo, beware of judging him too hastily and severely, as your way is, if\r\nthere is anything you do not like in him at first sight. I give you this\r\nwarning, although I feel sure that he will make a favourable impression\r\nupon you. Moreover, in order to understand any man one must be\r\ndeliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas,\r\nwhich are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards. And Pyotr\r\nPetrovitch, judging by many indications, is a thoroughly estimable man.\r\nAt his first visit, indeed, he told us that he was a practical man, but\r\nstill he shares, as he expressed it, many of the convictions ‘of our\r\nmost rising generation’ and he is an opponent of all prejudices. He\r\nsaid a good deal more, for he seems a little conceited and likes to be\r\nlistened to, but this is scarcely a vice. I, of course, understood very\r\nlittle of it, but Dounia explained to me that, though he is not a man\r\nof great education, he is clever and seems to be good-natured. You know\r\nyour sister’s character, Rodya. She is a resolute, sensible, patient and\r\ngenerous girl, but she has a passionate heart, as I know very well.\r\nOf course, there is no great love either on his side, or on hers, but\r\nDounia is a clever girl and has the heart of an angel, and will make\r\nit her duty to make her husband happy who on his side will make her\r\nhappiness his care. Of that we have no good reason to doubt, though it\r\nmust be admitted the matter has been arranged in great haste. Besides he\r\nis a man of great prudence and he will see, to be sure, of himself, that\r\nhis own happiness will be the more secure, the happier Dounia is with\r\nhim. And as for some defects of character, for some habits and even\r\ncertain differences of opinion--which indeed are inevitable even in\r\nthe happiest marriages--Dounia has said that, as regards all that, she\r\nrelies on herself, that there is nothing to be uneasy about, and\r\nthat she is ready to put up with a great deal, if only their future\r\nrelationship can be an honourable and straightforward one. He struck me,\r\nfor instance, at first, as rather abrupt, but that may well come\r\nfrom his being an outspoken man, and that is no doubt how it is. For\r\ninstance, at his second visit, after he had received Dounia’s consent,\r\nin the course of conversation, he declared that before making\r\nDounia’s acquaintance, he had made up his mind to marry a girl of\r\ngood reputation, without dowry and, above all, one who had experienced\r\npoverty, because, as he explained, a man ought not to be indebted to his\r\nwife, but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as her\r\nbenefactor. I must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely\r\nthan I have done, for I have forgotten his actual phrases and only\r\nremember the meaning. And, besides, it was obviously not said of design,\r\nbut slipped out in the heat of conversation, so that he tried afterwards\r\nto correct himself and smooth it over, but all the same it did strike\r\nme as somewhat rude, and I said so afterwards to Dounia. But Dounia was\r\nvexed, and answered that ‘words are not deeds,’ and that, of course, is\r\nperfectly true. Dounia did not sleep all night before she made up\r\nher mind, and, thinking that I was asleep, she got out of bed and was\r\nwalking up and down the room all night; at last she knelt down before\r\nthe ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told me\r\nthat she had decided.\r\n\r\n“I have mentioned already that Pyotr Petrovitch is just setting off for\r\nPetersburg, where he has a great deal of business, and he wants to open\r\na legal bureau. He has been occupied for many years in conducting civil\r\nand commercial litigation, and only the other day he won an important\r\ncase. He has to be in Petersburg because he has an important case before\r\nthe Senate. So, Rodya dear, he may be of the greatest use to you, in\r\nevery way indeed, and Dounia and I have agreed that from this very day\r\nyou could definitely enter upon your career and might consider that\r\nyour future is marked out and assured for you. Oh, if only this comes to\r\npass! This would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it as a\r\nprovidential blessing. Dounia is dreaming of nothing else. We have even\r\nventured already to drop a few words on the subject to Pyotr Petrovitch.\r\nHe was cautious in his answer, and said that, of course, as he could not\r\nget on without a secretary, it would be better to be paying a salary to\r\na relation than to a stranger, if only the former were fitted for the\r\nduties (as though there could be doubt of your being fitted!) but then\r\nhe expressed doubts whether your studies at the university would leave\r\nyou time for work at his office. The matter dropped for the time, but\r\nDounia is thinking of nothing else now. She has been in a sort of fever\r\nfor the last few days, and has already made a regular plan for\r\nyour becoming in the end an associate and even a partner in Pyotr\r\nPetrovitch’s business, which might well be, seeing that you are a\r\nstudent of law. I am in complete agreement with her, Rodya, and share\r\nall her plans and hopes, and think there is every probability of\r\nrealising them. And in spite of Pyotr Petrovitch’s evasiveness, very\r\nnatural at present (since he does not know you), Dounia is firmly\r\npersuaded that she will gain everything by her good influence over her\r\nfuture husband; this she is reckoning upon. Of course we are careful\r\nnot to talk of any of these more remote plans to Pyotr Petrovitch,\r\nespecially of your becoming his partner. He is a practical man and might\r\ntake this very coldly, it might all seem to him simply a day-dream. Nor\r\nhas either Dounia or I breathed a word to him of the great hopes we have\r\nof his helping us to pay for your university studies; we have not spoken\r\nof it in the first place, because it will come to pass of itself,\r\nlater on, and he will no doubt without wasting words offer to do it of\r\nhimself, (as though he could refuse Dounia that) the more readily since\r\nyou may by your own efforts become his right hand in the office, and\r\nreceive this assistance not as a charity, but as a salary earned by your\r\nown work. Dounia wants to arrange it all like this and I quite agree\r\nwith her. And we have not spoken of our plans for another reason, that\r\nis, because I particularly wanted you to feel on an equal footing when\r\nyou first meet him. When Dounia spoke to him with enthusiasm about\r\nyou, he answered that one could never judge of a man without seeing\r\nhim close, for oneself, and that he looked forward to forming his own\r\nopinion when he makes your acquaintance. Do you know, my precious\r\nRodya, I think that perhaps for some reasons (nothing to do with Pyotr\r\nPetrovitch though, simply for my own personal, perhaps old-womanish,\r\nfancies) I should do better to go on living by myself, apart, than with\r\nthem, after the wedding. I am convinced that he will be generous and\r\ndelicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain with my daughter\r\nfor the future, and if he has said nothing about it hitherto, it is\r\nsimply because it has been taken for granted; but I shall refuse. I have\r\nnoticed more than once in my life that husbands don’t quite get on with\r\ntheir mothers-in-law, and I don’t want to be the least bit in anyone’s\r\nway, and for my own sake, too, would rather be quite independent, so\r\nlong as I have a crust of bread of my own, and such children as you and\r\nDounia. If possible, I would settle somewhere near you, for the most\r\njoyful piece of news, dear Rodya, I have kept for the end of my letter:\r\nknow then, my dear boy, that we may, perhaps, be all together in a\r\nvery short time and may embrace one another again after a separation of\r\nalmost three years! It is settled _for certain_ that Dounia and I are to\r\nset off for Petersburg, exactly when I don’t know, but very, very soon,\r\npossibly in a week. It all depends on Pyotr Petrovitch who will let us\r\nknow when he has had time to look round him in Petersburg. To suit his\r\nown arrangements he is anxious to have the ceremony as soon as possible,\r\neven before the fast of Our Lady, if it could be managed, or if that is\r\ntoo soon to be ready, immediately after. Oh, with what happiness I shall\r\npress you to my heart! Dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought\r\nof seeing you, she said one day in joke that she would be ready to marry\r\nPyotr Petrovitch for that alone. She is an angel! She is not writing\r\nanything to you now, and has only told me to write that she has so much,\r\nso much to tell you that she is not going to take up her pen now, for\r\na few lines would tell you nothing, and it would only mean upsetting\r\nherself; she bids me send you her love and innumerable kisses. But\r\nalthough we shall be meeting so soon, perhaps I shall send you as much\r\nmoney as I can in a day or two. Now that everyone has heard that Dounia\r\nis to marry Pyotr Petrovitch, my credit has suddenly improved and I know\r\nthat Afanasy Ivanovitch will trust me now even to seventy-five roubles\r\non the security of my pension, so that perhaps I shall be able to send\r\nyou twenty-five or even thirty roubles. I would send you more, but I am\r\nuneasy about our travelling expenses; for though Pyotr Petrovitch has\r\nbeen so kind as to undertake part of the expenses of the journey, that\r\nis to say, he has taken upon himself the conveyance of our bags and big\r\ntrunk (which will be conveyed through some acquaintances of his), we\r\nmust reckon upon some expense on our arrival in Petersburg, where we\r\ncan’t be left without a halfpenny, at least for the first few days. But\r\nwe have calculated it all, Dounia and I, to the last penny, and we see\r\nthat the journey will not cost very much. It is only ninety versts from\r\nus to the railway and we have come to an agreement with a driver we\r\nknow, so as to be in readiness; and from there Dounia and I can travel\r\nquite comfortably third class. So that I may very likely be able to send\r\nto you not twenty-five, but thirty roubles. But enough; I have covered\r\ntwo sheets already and there is no space left for more; our whole\r\nhistory, but so many events have happened! And now, my precious Rodya,\r\nI embrace you and send you a mother’s blessing till we meet. Love Dounia\r\nyour sister, Rodya; love her as she loves you and understand that she\r\nloves you beyond everything, more than herself. She is an angel and you,\r\nRodya, you are everything to us--our one hope, our one consolation. If\r\nonly you are happy, we shall be happy. Do you still say your prayers,\r\nRodya, and believe in the mercy of our Creator and our Redeemer? I am\r\nafraid in my heart that you may have been visited by the new spirit of\r\ninfidelity that is abroad to-day; If it is so, I pray for you. Remember,\r\ndear boy, how in your childhood, when your father was living, you used\r\nto lisp your prayers at my knee, and how happy we all were in those\r\ndays. Good-bye, till we meet then--I embrace you warmly, warmly, with\r\nmany kisses.\r\n\r\n“Yours till death,\r\n\r\n“PULCHERIA RASKOLNIKOV.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost from the first, while he read the letter, Raskolnikov’s face was\r\nwet with tears; but when he finished it, his face was pale and distorted\r\nand a bitter, wrathful and malignant smile was on his lips. He laid his\r\nhead down on his threadbare dirty pillow and pondered, pondered a long\r\ntime. His heart was beating violently, and his brain was in a turmoil.\r\nAt last he felt cramped and stifled in the little yellow room that was\r\nlike a cupboard or a box. His eyes and his mind craved for space. He\r\ntook up his hat and went out, this time without dread of meeting\r\nanyone; he had forgotten his dread. He turned in the direction of the\r\nVassilyevsky Ostrov, walking along Vassilyevsky Prospect, as though\r\nhastening on some business, but he walked, as his habit was, without\r\nnoticing his way, muttering and even speaking aloud to himself, to the\r\nastonishment of the passers-by. Many of them took him to be drunk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nHis mother’s letter had been a torture to him, but as regards the chief\r\nfact in it, he had felt not one moment’s hesitation, even whilst he was\r\nreading the letter. The essential question was settled, and irrevocably\r\nsettled, in his mind: “Never such a marriage while I am alive and\r\nMr. Luzhin be damned!” “The thing is perfectly clear,” he muttered\r\nto himself, with a malignant smile anticipating the triumph of his\r\ndecision. “No, mother, no, Dounia, you won’t deceive me! and then they\r\napologise for not asking my advice and for taking the decision without\r\nme! I dare say! They imagine it is arranged now and can’t be broken\r\noff; but we will see whether it can or not! A magnificent excuse:\r\n‘Pyotr Petrovitch is such a busy man that even his wedding has to be in\r\npost-haste, almost by express.’ No, Dounia, I see it all and I know what\r\nyou want to say to me; and I know too what you were thinking about, when\r\nyou walked up and down all night, and what your prayers were like before\r\nthe Holy Mother of Kazan who stands in mother’s bedroom. Bitter is\r\nthe ascent to Golgotha.... Hm... so it is finally settled; you have\r\ndetermined to marry a sensible business man, Avdotya Romanovna, one\r\nwho has a fortune (has _already_ made his fortune, that is so much\r\nmore solid and impressive), a man who holds two government posts and who\r\nshares the ideas of our most rising generation, as mother writes, and\r\nwho _seems_ to be kind, as Dounia herself observes. That _seems_ beats\r\neverything! And that very Dounia for that very ‘_seems_’ is marrying\r\nhim! Splendid! splendid!\r\n\r\n“... But I should like to know why mother has written to me about ‘our\r\nmost rising generation’? Simply as a descriptive touch, or with the idea\r\nof prepossessing me in favour of Mr. Luzhin? Oh, the cunning of them!\r\nI should like to know one thing more: how far they were open with one\r\nanother that day and night and all this time since? Was it all put into\r\n_words_, or did both understand that they had the same thing at heart\r\nand in their minds, so that there was no need to speak of it aloud, and\r\nbetter not to speak of it. Most likely it was partly like that, from\r\nmother’s letter it’s evident: he struck her as rude _a little_, and\r\nmother in her simplicity took her observations to Dounia. And she was\r\nsure to be vexed and ‘answered her angrily.’ I should think so! Who\r\nwould not be angered when it was quite clear without any naïve questions\r\nand when it was understood that it was useless to discuss it. And why\r\ndoes she write to me, ‘love Dounia, Rodya, and she loves you more than\r\nherself’? Has she a secret conscience-prick at sacrificing her daughter\r\nto her son? ‘You are our one comfort, you are everything to us.’ Oh,\r\nmother!”\r\n\r\nHis bitterness grew more and more intense, and if he had happened to\r\nmeet Mr. Luzhin at the moment, he might have murdered him.\r\n\r\n“Hm... yes, that’s true,” he continued, pursuing the whirling ideas that\r\nchased each other in his brain, “it is true that ‘it needs time and care\r\nto get to know a man,’ but there is no mistake about Mr. Luzhin. The\r\nchief thing is he is ‘a man of business and _seems_ kind,’ that was\r\nsomething, wasn’t it, to send the bags and big box for them! A kind man,\r\nno doubt after that! But his _bride_ and her mother are to drive in a\r\npeasant’s cart covered with sacking (I know, I have been driven in\r\nit). No matter! It is only ninety versts and then they can ‘travel very\r\ncomfortably, third class,’ for a thousand versts! Quite right, too. One\r\nmust cut one’s coat according to one’s cloth, but what about you, Mr.\r\nLuzhin? She is your bride.... And you must be aware that her mother has\r\nto raise money on her pension for the journey. To be sure it’s a matter\r\nof business, a partnership for mutual benefit, with equal shares and\r\nexpenses;--food and drink provided, but pay for your tobacco. The\r\nbusiness man has got the better of them, too. The luggage will cost less\r\nthan their fares and very likely go for nothing. How is it that they\r\ndon’t both see all that, or is it that they don’t want to see? And\r\nthey are pleased, pleased! And to think that this is only the first\r\nblossoming, and that the real fruits are to come! But what really\r\nmatters is not the stinginess, is not the meanness, but the _tone_\r\nof the whole thing. For that will be the tone after marriage, it’s a\r\nforetaste of it.

      "description": "\"Little Women; Or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy\" by Louisa May Alcott is a classic novel written in the mid-19th century. The story revolves around the lives and experiences of four sisters—Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March—as they navigate the challenges of growing up in a modest household during the American Civil War. The novel explores themes of family, sacrifice, and the pursuit of personal dreams, showcasing the distinct personalities and aspirations of each sister.  The opening of the book introduces readers to the March sisters, who are grappling with their financial struggles and longing for a more comfortable life. As they gather around the fire to express their frustrations about being poor, their mother reinforces the idea that they should embrace gratitude and make sacrifices for those suffering during the war, particularly their father, who is away serving as a chaplain. This chapter sets the tone for the sisters' individual journeys, highlighting their different approaches to hardship—Meg longs for material wealth, Jo is a spirited tomboy who craves independence, Beth is the gentle peacemaker, and Amy is the aspiring artist concerned with appearances. Through their interactions and hopes, Alcott paints a vivid picture of their lives, filled with warmth, humor, and the bonds of sisterhood. (This is an automatically generated summary.)",

reason mother proposed not having any presents this\r\nChristmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for every one; and\r\nshe thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure, when our men are\r\nsuffering so in the army. We can't do much, but we can make our little\r\nsacrifices, and ought to do it gladly. But I am afraid I don't;\" and Meg\r\nshook her head, as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\n\"But I don't think the little we should spend would do any good. We've\r\neach got a dollar, and the army wouldn't be much helped by our giving\r\nthat. I agree not to expect anything from mother or you, but I do want\r\nto buy Undine and Sintram for myself; I've wanted it _so_ long,\" said\r\nJo, who was a bookworm.\r\n\r\n\"I planned to spend mine in new music,\" said Beth, with a little sigh,\r\nwhich no one heard but the hearth-brush and kettle-holder.\r\n\r\n\"I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing-pencils; I really need them,\"\r\nsaid Amy decidedly.\r\n\r\n\"Mother didn't say anything about our money, and she won't wish us to\r\ngive up everything. Let's each buy what we want, and have a little fun;\r\nI'm sure we work hard enough to earn it,\" cried Jo, examining the heels\r\nof her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.\r\n\r\n\"I know _I_ do,--teaching those tiresome children nearly all day, when\r\nI'm longing to enjoy myself at home,\" began Meg, in the complaining tone\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"You don't have half such a hard time as I do,\" said Jo. \"How would you\r\nlike to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps\r\nyou trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you're ready to\r\nfly out of the window or cry?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's naughty to fret; but I do think washing dishes and keeping things\r\ntidy is the worst work in the world. It makes me cross; and my hands get\r\nso stiff, I can't practise well at all;\" and Beth looked at her rough\r\nhands with a sigh that any one could hear that time.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe any of you suffer as I do,\" cried Amy; \"for you don't\r\nhave to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you don't\r\nknow your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your father if\r\nhe isn't rich, and insult you when your nose isn't nice.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you mean _libel_, I'd say so, and not talk about _labels_, as if\r\npapa was a pickle-bottle,\" advised Jo, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"I know what I mean, and you needn't be _statirical_ about it. It's\r\nproper to use good words, and improve your _vocabilary_,\" returned Amy,\r\nwith dignity.\r\n\r\n\"Don't peck at one another, children. Don't you wish we had the money\r\npapa lost when we were little, Jo? Dear me! how happy and good we'd be,\r\nif we had no worries!\" said Meg, who could remember better times.\r\n\r\n\"You said the other day, you thought we were a deal happier than the\r\nKing children, for they were fighting and fretting all the time, in\r\nspite of their money.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I did, Beth. Well, I think we are; for, though we do have to work,\r\nwe make fun for ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo would say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jo does use such slang words!\" observed Amy, with a reproving look at\r\nthe long figure stretched on the rug. Jo immediately sat up, put her\r\nhands in her pockets, and began to whistle.\r\n\r\n\"Don't, Jo; it's so boyish!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's why I do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I detest rude, unlady-like girls!\"\r\n\r\n\"I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!\"\r\n\r\n\"'Birds in their little nests agree,'\" sang Beth, the peace-maker, with\r\nsuch a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh, and the\r\n\"pecking\" ended for that time.\r\n\r\n\"Really, girls, you are both to be blamed,\" said Meg, beginning to\r\nlecture in her elder-sisterly fashion. \"You are old enough to leave off\r\nboyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine. It didn't matter so much\r\nwhen you were a little girl; but now you are so tall, and turn up your\r\nhair, you should remember that you are a young lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not! and if turning up my hair makes me one, I'll wear it in two\r\ntails till I'm twenty,\" cried Jo, pulling off her net, and shaking down\r\na chestnut mane. \"I hate to think I've got to grow up, and be Miss\r\nMarch, and wear long gowns, and look as prim as a China-aster! It's bad\r\nenough to be a girl, anyway, when I like boys' games and work and\r\nmanners! I can't get over my disappointment in not being a boy; and it's\r\nworse than ever now, for I'm dying to go and fight with papa, and I can\r\nonly stay at home and knit, like a poky old woman!\" And Jo shook the\r\nblue army-sock till the needles rattled like castanets, and her ball\r\nbounded across the room.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Jo! It's too bad, but it can't be helped; so you must try to be\r\ncontented with making your name boyish, and playing brother to us\r\ngirls,\" said Beth, stroking the rough head at her knee with a hand that\r\nall the dish-washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in\r\nits touch.\r\n\r\n\"As for you, Amy,\" continued Meg, \"you are altogether too particular and\r\nprim. Your airs are funny now; but you'll grow up an affected little\r\ngoose, if you don't take care. I like your nice manners and refined ways\r\nof speaking, when you don't try to be elegant; but your absurd words are\r\nas bad as Jo's slang.\"\r\n\r\n\"If Jo is a tom-boy and Amy a goose, what am I, please?\" asked Beth,\r\nready to share the lecture.\r\n\r\n\"You're a dear, and nothing else,\" answered Meg warmly; and no one\r\ncontradicted her, for the \"Mouse\" was the pet of the family.\r\n\r\nAs young readers like to know \"how people look,\" we will take this\r\nmoment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters, who sat\r\nknitting away in the twilight, while the December snow fell quietly\r\nwithout, and the fire crackled cheerfully within. It was a comfortable\r\nold room, though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain; for\r\na good picture or two hung on the walls, books filled the recesses,\r\nchrysanthemums and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows, and a\r\npleasant atmosphere of home-peace pervaded it.\r\n\r\nMargaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, being\r\nplump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft, brown hair, a sweet\r\nmouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain. Fifteen-year-old\r\nJo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a colt; for she\r\nnever seemed to know what to do with her long limbs, which were very\r\nmuch in her way. She had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp,\r\ngray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce,\r\nfunny, or thoughtful. Her long, thick hair was her one beauty; but it\r\nwas usually bundled into a net, to be out of her way. Round shoulders\r\nhad Jo, big hands and feet, a fly-away look to her clothes, and the\r\nuncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a\r\nwoman, and didn't like it. Elizabeth--or Beth, as every one called\r\nher--was a rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy\r\nmanner, a timid voice, and a peaceful expression, which was seldom\r\ndisturbed. Her father called her \"Little Tranquillity,\" and the name\r\nsuited her excellently; for she seemed to live in a happy world of her\r\nown, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved. Amy,\r\nthough the youngest, was a most important person,--in her own opinion at\r\nleast. A regular snow-maiden, with blue eyes, and yellow hair, curling\r\non her shoulders, pale and slender, and always carrying herself like a\r\nyoung lady mindful of her manners. What the characters of the four\r\nsisters were we will leave to be found out.\r\n\r\nThe clock struck six; and, having swept up the hearth, Beth put a pair\r\nof slippers down to warm. Somehow the sight of the old shoes had a good\r\neffect upon the girls; for mother was coming, and every one brightened\r\nto welcome her. Meg stopped lecturing, and lighted the lamp, Amy got out\r\nof the easy-chair without being asked, and Jo forgot how tired she was\r\nas she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the blaze.\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: Beth put a pair of slippers down to warm]\r\n\r\n\"They are quite worn out; Marmee must have a new pair.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought I'd get her some with my dollar,\" said Beth.\r\n\r\n\"No, I shall!\" cried Amy.\r\n\r\n\"I'm the oldest,\" began Meg, but Jo cut in with a decided--\r\n\r\n\"I'm the man of the family now papa is away, and _I_ shall provide the\r\nslippers, for he told me to take special care of mother while he was\r\ngone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what we'll do,\" said Beth; \"let's each get her something\r\nfor Christmas, and not get anything for ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's like you, dear! What will we get?\" exclaimed Jo.\r\n\r\nEvery one thought soberly for a minute; then Meg announced, as if the\r\nidea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands, \"I shall give\r\nher a nice pair of gloves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Army shoes, best to be had,\" cried Jo.\r\n\r\n\"Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed,\" said Beth.\r\n\r\n\"I'll get a little bottle of cologne; she likes it, and it won't cost\r\nmuch, so I'll have some left to buy my pencils,\" added Amy.\r\n\r\n\"How will we give the things?\" asked Meg.\r\n\r\n\"Put them on the table, and bring her in and see her open the bundles.\r\nDon't you remember how we used to do on our birthdays?\" answered Jo.\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: I used to be so frightened when it was my\r\n                     turn to sit in the big chair]\r\n\r\n\"I used to be _so_ frightened when it was my turn to sit in the big\r\nchair with the crown on, and see you all come marching round to give the\r\npresents, with a kiss. I liked the things and the kisses, but it was\r\ndreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened the bundles,\" said\r\nBeth, who was toasting her face and the bread for tea, at the same time.\r\n\r\n\"Let Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves, and then surprise\r\nher. We must go shopping to-morrow afternoon, Meg; there is so much to\r\ndo about the play for Christmas night,\" said Jo, marching up and down,\r\nwith her hands behind her back and her nose in the air.\r\n\r\n\"I don't mean to act any more after this time; I'm getting too old for\r\nsuch things,\" observed Meg, who was as much a child as ever about\r\n\"dressing-up\" frolics.\r\n\r\n\"You won't stop, I know, as long as you can trail round in a white gown\r\nwith your hair down, and wear gold-paper jewelry. You are the best\r\nactress we've got, and there'll be an end of everything if you quit the\r\nboards,\" said Jo. \"We ought to rehearse to-night. Come here, Amy, and do\r\nthe fainting scene, for you are as stiff as a poker in that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't help it; I never saw any one faint, and I don't choose to make\r\nmyself all black and blue, tumbling flat as you do. If I can go down\r\neasily, I'll drop; if I can't, I shall fall into a chair and be\r\ngraceful; I don't care if Hugo does come at me with a pistol,\" returned\r\nAmy, who was not gifted with dramatic power, but was chosen because she\r\nwas small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain of the piece.\r\n\r\n          [Illustration: Do it this way, clasp your hands so]\r\n\r\n\"Do it this way; clasp your hands so, and stagger across the room,\r\ncrying frantically, 'Roderigo! save me! save me!'\" and away went Jo,\r\nwith a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling.\r\n\r\nAmy followed, but she poked her hands out stiffly before her, and jerked\r\nherself along as if she went by machinery; and her \"Ow!\" was more\r\nsuggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish. Jo gave\r\na despairing groan, and Meg laughed outright, while Beth let her bread\r\nburn as she watched the fun, with interest.\r\n\r\n\"It's no use! Do the best you can when the time comes, and if the\r\naudience laugh, don't blame me. Come on, Meg.\"\r\n\r\nThen things went smoothly, for Don Pedro defied the world in a speech of\r\ntwo pages without a single break; Hagar, the witch, chanted an awful\r\nincantation over her kettleful of simmering toads, with weird effect;\r\nRoderigo rent his chains asunder manfully, and Hugo died in agonies of\r\nremorse and arsenic, with a wild \"Ha! ha!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the best we've had yet,\" said Meg, as the dead villain sat up and\r\nrubbed his elbows.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see how you can write and act such splendid things, Jo. You're\r\na regular Shakespeare!\" exclaimed Beth, who firmly believed that her\r\nsisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things.\r\n\r\n\"Not quite,\" replied Jo modestly. \"I do think 'The Witch's Curse, an\r\nOperatic Tragedy,' is rather a nice thing; but I'd like to try Macbeth,\r\nif we only had a trap-door for Banquo. I always wanted to do the killing\r\npart. 'Is that a dagger that I see before me?'\" muttered Jo, rolling her\r\neyes and clutching at the air, as she had seen a famous tragedian do.\r\n\r\n\"No, it's the toasting fork, with mother's shoe on it instead of the\r\nbread. Beth's stage-struck!\" cried Meg, and the rehearsal ended in a\r\ngeneral burst of laughter.\r\n\r\n\"Glad to find you so merry, my girls,\" said a cheery voice at the door,\r\nand actors and audience turned to welcome a tall, motherly lady, with a\r\n\"can-I-help-you\" look about her which was truly delightful. She was not\r\nelegantly dressed, but a noble-looking woman, and the girls thought the\r\ngray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\"Well, dearies, how have you got on to-day? There was so much to do,\r\ngetting the boxes ready to go to-morrow, that I didn't come home to\r\ndinner. Has any one called, Beth? How is your cold, Meg? Jo, you look\r\ntired to death. Come and kiss me, baby.\"\r\n\r\nWhile making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got her wet things off,\r\nher warm slippers on, and sitting down in the easy-chair, drew Amy to\r\nher lap, preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day. The girls\r\nflew about, trying to make things comfortable, each in her own way. Meg\r\narranged the tea-table; Jo brought wood and set chairs, dropping,\r\noverturning, and clattering everything she touched; Beth trotted to and\r\nfro between parlor and kitchen, quiet and busy; while Amy gave\r\ndirections to every one, as she sat with her hands folded.\r\n\r\nAs they gathered about the table, Mrs. March said, with a particularly\r\nhappy face, \"I've got a treat for you after supper.\"\r\n\r\nA quick, bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine. Beth clapped\r\nher hands, regardless of the biscuit she held, and Jo tossed up her\r\nnapkin, crying, \"A letter! a letter! Three cheers for father!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a nice long letter. He is well, and thinks he shall get through\r\nthe cold season better than we feared. He sends all sorts of loving\r\nwishes for Christmas, and an especial message to you girls,\" said Mrs.\r\nMarch, patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there.\r\n\r\n\"Hurry and get done! Don't stop to quirk your little finger, and simper\r\nover your plate, Amy,\" cried Jo, choking in her tea, and dropping her\r\nbread, butter side down, on the carpet, in her haste to get at the\r\ntreat.\r\n\r\nBeth ate no more, but crept away, to sit in her shadowy corner and brood\r\nover the delight to come, till the others were ready.\r\n\r\n\"I think it was so splendid in father to go as a chaplain when he was\r\ntoo old to be drafted, and not strong enough for a soldier,\" said Meg\r\nwarmly.\r\n\r\n\"Don't I wish I could go as a drummer, a _vivan_--what's its name? or a\r\nnurse, so I could be near him and help him,\" exclaimed Jo, with a groan.\r\n\r\n\"It must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent, and eat all sorts of\r\nbad-tasting things, and drink out of a tin mug,\" sighed Amy.\r\n\r\n\"When will he come home, Marmee?\" asked Beth, with a little quiver in\r\nher voice.\r\n\r\n\"Not for many months, dear, unless he is sick. He will stay and do his\r\nwork faithfully as long as he can, and we won't ask for him back a\r\nminute sooner than he can be spared. Now come and hear the letter.\"\r\n\r\nThey all drew to the fire, mother in the big chair with Beth at her\r\nfeet, Meg and Amy perched on either arm of the chair, and Jo leaning on\r\nthe back, where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter\r\nshould happen to be touching.\r\n\r\nVery few letters were written in those hard times that were not\r\ntouching, especially those which fathers sent home. In this one little\r\nwas said of the hardships endured, the dangers faced, or the\r\nhomesickness conquered; it was a cheerful, hopeful letter, full of\r\nlively descriptions of camp life, marches, and military news; and only\r\nat the end did the writer's heart overflow with fatherly love and\r\nlonging for the little girls at home.\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: It was a cheerful, hopeful letter]\r\n\r\n\"Give them all my dear love and a kiss. Tell them I think of them by\r\nday, pray for them by night, and find my best comfort in their affection\r\nat all times. A year seems very long to wait before I see them, but\r\nremind them that while we wait we may all work, so that these hard days\r\nneed not be wasted. I know they will remember all I said to them, that\r\nthey will be loving children to you, will do their duty faithfully,\r\nfight their bosom enemies bravely, and conquer themselves so\r\nbeautifully, that when I come back to them I may be fonder and prouder\r\nthan ever of my little women.\"\r\n\r\nEverybody sniffed when they came to that part; Jo wasn't ashamed of the\r\ngreat tear that dropped off the end of her nose, and Amy never minded\r\nthe rumpling of her curls as she hid her face on her mother's shoulder\r\nand sobbed out, \"I _am_ a selfish girl! but I'll truly try to be better,\r\nso he mayn't be disappointed in me by and by.\"\r\n\r\n\"We all will!\" cried Meg. \"I think too much of my looks, and hate to\r\nwork, but won't any more, if I can help it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll try and be what he loves to call me, 'a little woman,' and not be\r\nrough and wild; but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere\r\nelse,\" said Jo, thinking that keeping her temper at home was a much\r\nharder task than facing a rebel or two down South.\r\n\r\nBeth said nothing, but wiped away her tears with the blue army-sock, and\r\nbegan to knit with all her might, losing no time in doing the duty that\r\nlay nearest her, while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all\r\nthat father hoped to find her when the year brought round the happy\r\ncoming home.\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: How you used to play Pilgrim's Progress]\r\n\r\nMrs. March broke the silence that followed Jo's words, by saying in her\r\ncheery voice, \"Do you remember how you used to play Pilgrim's Progress\r\nwhen you were little things? Nothing delighted you more than to have me\r\ntie my piece-bags on your backs for burdens, give you hats and sticks\r\nand rolls of paper, and let you travel through the house from the\r\ncellar, which was the City of Destruction, up, up, to the house-top,\r\nwhere you had all the lovely things you could collect to make a\r\nCelestial City.\"\r\n\r\n\"What fun it was, especially going by the lions, fighting Apollyon, and\r\npassing through the Valley where the hobgoblins were!\" said Jo.\r\n\r\n\"I liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled down stairs,\"\r\nsaid Meg.\r\n\r\n\"My favorite part was when we came out on the flat roof where our\r\nflowers and arbors and pretty things were, and all stood and sung for\r\njoy up there in the sunshine,\" said Beth, smiling, as if that pleasant\r\nmoment had come back to her.\r\n\r\n\"I don't remember much about it, except that I was afraid of the cellar\r\nand the dark entry, and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the\r\ntop. If I wasn't too old for such things, I'd rather like to play it\r\nover again,\" said Amy, who began to talk of renouncing childish things\r\nat the mature age of twelve.\r\n\r\n\"We never are too old for this, my dear, because it is a play we are\r\nplaying all the time in one way or another. Our burdens are here, our\r\nroad is before us, and the longing for goodness and happiness is the\r\nguide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace\r\nwhich is a true Celestial City. Now, my little pilgrims, suppose you\r\nbegin again, not in play, but in earnest, and see how far on you can get\r\nbefore father comes home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, mother? Where are our bundles?\" asked Amy, who was a very\r\nliteral young lady.\r\n\r\n\"Each of you told what your burden was just now, except Beth; I rather\r\nthink she hasn't got any,\" said her mother.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have; mine is dishes and dusters, and envying girls with nice\r\npianos, and being afraid of people.\"\r\n\r\nBeth's bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh; but\r\nnobody did, for it would have hurt her feelings very much.\r\n\r\n\"Let us do it,\" said Meg thoughtfully. \"It is only another name for\r\ntrying to be good, and the story may help us; for though we do want to\r\nbe good, it's hard work, and we forget, and don't do our best.\"\r\n\r\n\"We were in the Slough of Despond to-night, and mother came and pulled\r\nus out as Help did in the book. We ought to have our roll of directions,\r\nlike Christian. What shall we do about that?\" asked Jo, delighted with\r\nthe fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull task of doing her\r\nduty.\r\n\r\n\"Look under your pillows, Christmas morning, and you will find your\r\nguide-book,\" replied Mrs. March.\r\n\r\nThey talked over the new plan while old Hannah cleared the table; then\r\nout came the four little work-baskets, and the needles flew as the girls\r\nmade sheets for Aunt March. It was uninteresting sewing, but to-night no\r\none grumbled. They adopted Jo's plan of dividing the long seams into\r\nfour parts, and calling the quarters Europe, Asia, Africa, and America,\r\nand in that way got on capitally, especially when they talked about the\r\ndifferent countries as they stitched their way through them.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: No one but Beth could get much music out of the old\r\n                                 piano]\r\n\r\nAt nine they stopped work, and sung, as usual, before they went to bed.\r\nNo one but Beth could get much music out of the old piano; but she had a\r\nway of softly touching the yellow keys, and making a pleasant\r\naccompaniment to the simple songs they sung. Meg had a voice like a\r\nflute, and she and her mother led the little choir. Amy chirped like a\r\ncricket, and Jo wandered through the airs at her own sweet will, always\r\ncoming out at the wrong place with a croak or a quaver that spoilt the\r\nmost pensive tune. They had always done this from the time they could\r\nlisp\r\n\r\n        \"Crinkle, crinkle, 'ittle 'tar,\"\r\n\r\nand it had become a household custom, for the mother was a born singer.\r\nThe first sound in the morning was her voice, as she went about the\r\nhouse singing like a lark; and the last sound at night was the same\r\ncheery sound, for the girls never grew too old for that familiar\r\nlullaby.\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: At nine they stopped work and sung as usual]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: A Merry Christmas]\r\n\r\n                                   II.\r\n\r\n                           A MERRY CHRISTMAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nJo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of Christmas morning. No\r\nstockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she felt as much\r\ndisappointed as she did long ago, when her little sock fell down because\r\nit was so crammed with goodies. Then she remembered her mother's\r\npromise, and, slipping her hand under her pillow, drew out a little\r\ncrimson-covered book. She knew it very well, for it was that beautiful\r\nold story of the best life ever lived, and Jo felt that it was a true\r\nguide-book for any pilgrim going the long journey. She woke Meg with a\r\n\"Merry Christmas,\" and bade her see what was under her pillow. A\r\ngreen-covered book appeared, with the same picture inside, and a few\r\nwords written by their mother, which made their one present very\r\nprecious in their eyes. Presently Beth and Amy woke, to rummage and find\r\ntheir little books also,--one dove-colored, the other blue; and all sat\r\nlooking at and talking about them, while the east grew rosy with the\r\ncoming day.\r\n\r\nIn spite of her small vanities, Margaret had a sweet and pious nature,\r\nwhich unconsciously influenced her sisters, especially Jo, who loved her\r\nvery tenderly, and obeyed her because her advice was so gently given.\r\n\r\n\"Girls,\" said Meg seriously, looking from the tumbled head beside her to\r\nthe two little night-capped ones in the room beyond, \"mother wants us to\r\nread and love and mind these books, and we must begin at once. We used\r\nto be faithful about it; but since father went away, and all this war\r\ntrouble unsettled us, we have neglected many things. You can do as you\r\nplease; but _I_ shall keep my book on the table here, and read a little\r\nevery morning as soon as I wake, for I know it will do me good, and help\r\nme through the day.\"\r\n\r\nThen she opened her new book and began to read. Jo put her arm round\r\nher, and, leaning cheek to cheek, read also, with the quiet expression\r\nso seldom seen on her restless face.\r\n\r\n\"How good Meg is! Come, Amy, let's do as they do. I'll help you with the\r\nhard words, and they'll explain things if we don't understand,\"\r\nwhispered Beth, very much impressed by the pretty books and her sisters'\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad mine is blue,\" said Amy; and then the rooms were very still\r\nwhile the pages were softly turned, and the winter sunshine crept in to\r\ntouch the bright heads and serious faces with a Christmas greeting.\r\n\r\n\"Where is mother?\" asked Meg, as she and Jo ran down to thank her for\r\ntheir gifts, half an hour later.\r\n\r\n\"Goodness only knows. Some poor creeter come a-beggin', and your ma went\r\nstraight off to see what was needed. There never _was_ such a woman for\r\ngivin' away vittles and drink, clothes and firin',\" replied Hannah, who\r\nhad lived with the family since Meg was born, and was considered by them\r\nall more as a friend than a servant.\r\n\r\n\"She will be back soon, I think; so fry your cakes, and have everything\r\nready,\" said Meg, looking over the presents which were collected in a\r\nbasket and kept under the sofa, ready to be produced at the proper time.\r\n\"Why, where is Amy's bottle of cologne?\" she added, as the little flask\r\ndid not appear.\r\n\r\n\"She took it out a minute ago, and went off with it to put a ribbon on\r\nit, or some such notion,\" replied Jo, dancing about the room to take the\r\nfirst stiffness off the new army-slippers.\r\n\r\n\"How nice my handkerchiefs look, don't they? Hannah washed and ironed\r\nthem for me, and I marked them all myself,\" said Beth, looking proudly\r\nat the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such labor.\r\n\r\n\"Bless the child! she's gone and put 'Mother' on them instead of 'M.\r\nMarch.' How funny!\" cried Jo, taking up one.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it right? I thought it was better to do it so, because Meg's\r\ninitials are 'M. M.,' and I don't want any one to use these but Marmee,\"\r\nsaid Beth, looking troubled.\r\n\r\n\"It's all right, dear, and a very pretty idea,--quite sensible, too, for\r\nno one can ever mistake now. It will please her very much, I know,\" said\r\nMeg, with a frown for Jo and a smile for Beth.\r\n\r\n\"There's mother. Hide the basket, quick!\" cried Jo, as a door slammed,\r\nand steps sounded in the hall.\r\n\r\nAmy came in hastily, and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters\r\nall waiting for her.\r\n\r\n\"Where have you been, and what are you hiding behind you?\" asked Meg,\r\nsurprised to see, by her hood and cloak, that lazy Amy had been out so\r\nearly.\r\n\r\n\"Don't laugh at me, Jo! I didn't mean any one should know till the time\r\ncame. I only meant to change the little bottle for a big one, and I gave\r\n_all_ my money to get it, and I'm truly trying not to be selfish any\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, Amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap\r\none; and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget\r\nherself that Meg hugged her on the spot, and Jo pronounced her \"a\r\ntrump,\" while Beth ran to the window, and picked her finest rose to\r\nornament the stately bottle.\r\n\r\n\"You see I felt ashamed of my present, after reading and talking about\r\nbeing good this morning, so I ran round the corner and changed it the\r\nminute I was up: and I'm _so_ glad, for mine is the handsomest now.\"\r\n\r\nAnother bang of the street-door sent the basket under the sofa, and the\r\ngirls to the table, eager for breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"Merry Christmas, Marmee! Many of them! Thank you for our books; we read\r\nsome, and mean to every day,\" they cried, in chorus.\r\n\r\n\"Merry Christmas, little daughters! I'm glad you began at once, and hope\r\nyou will keep on. But I want to say one word before we sit down. Not far\r\naway from here lies a poor woman with a little new-born baby. Six\r\nchildren are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing, for they have\r\nno fire. There is nothing to eat over there; and the oldest boy came to\r\ntell me they were suffering hunger and cold. My girls, will you give\r\nthem your breakfast as a Christmas present?\"\r\n\r\nThey were all unusually hungry, having waited nearly an hour, and for a\r\nminute no one spoke; only a minute, for Jo exclaimed impetuously,--\r\n\r\n\"I'm so glad you came before we began!\"\r\n\r\n\"May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?\" asked\r\nBeth, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"_I_ shall take the cream and the muffins,\" added Amy, heroically giving\r\nup the articles she most liked.\r\n\r\nMeg was already covering the buckwheats, and piling the bread into one\r\nbig plate.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you'd do it,\" said Mrs. March, smiling as if satisfied. \"You\r\nshall all go and help me, and when we come back we will have bread and\r\nmilk for breakfast, and make it up at dinner-time.\"\r\n\r\nThey were soon ready, and the procession set out. Fortunately it was\r\nearly, and they went through back streets, so few people saw them, and\r\nno one laughed at the queer party.\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: The procession set out]\r\n\r\nA poor, bare, miserable room it was, with broken windows, no fire,\r\nragged bed-clothes, a sick mother, wailing baby, and a group of pale,\r\nhungry children cuddled under one old quilt, trying to keep warm.\r\n\r\nHow the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in!\r\n\r\n\"Ach, mein Gott! it is good angels come to us!\" said the poor woman,\r\ncrying for joy.\r\n\r\n\"Funny angels in hoods and mittens,\" said Jo, and set them laughing.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work\r\nthere. Hannah, who had carried wood, made a fire, and stopped up the\r\nbroken panes with old hats and her own cloak. Mrs. March gave the mother\r\ntea and gruel, and comforted her with promises of help, while she\r\ndressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own. The\r\ngirls, meantime, spread the table, set the children round the fire, and\r\nfed them like so many hungry birds,--laughing, talking, and trying to\r\nunderstand the funny broken English.\r\n\r\n\"Das ist gut!\" \"Die Engel-kinder!\" cried the poor things, as they ate,\r\nand warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze.\r\n\r\nThe girls had never been called angel children before, and thought it\r\nvery agreeable, especially Jo, who had been considered a \"Sancho\" ever\r\nsince she was born. That was a very happy breakfast, though they didn't\r\nget any of it; and when they went away, leaving comfort behind, I think\r\nthere were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry\r\nlittle girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves\r\nwith bread and milk on Christmas morning.\r\n\r\n\"That's loving our neighbor better than ourselves, and I like it,\" said\r\nMeg, as they set out their presents, while their mother was upstairs\r\ncollecting clothes for the poor Hummels.\r\n\r\nNot a very splendid show, but there was a great deal of love done up in\r\nthe few little bundles; and the tall vase of red roses, white\r\nchrysanthemums, and trailing vines, which stood in the middle, gave\r\nquite an elegant air to the table.\r\n\r\n\"She's coming! Strike up, Beth! Open the door, Amy! Three cheers for\r\nMarmee!\" cried Jo, prancing about, while Meg went to conduct mother to\r\nthe seat of honor.\r\n\r\nBeth played her gayest march, Amy threw open the door, and Meg enacted\r\nescort with great dignity. Mrs. March was both surprised and touched;\r\nand smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents, and read the\r\nlittle notes which accompanied them. The slippers went on at once, a new\r\nhandkerchief was slipped into her pocket, well scented with Amy's\r\ncologne, the rose was fastened in her bosom, and the nice gloves were\r\npronounced a \"perfect fit.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining, in the\r\nsimple, loving fashion which makes these home-festivals so pleasant at\r\nthe time, so sweet to remember long afterward, and then all fell to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of\r\nthe day was devoted to preparations for the evening festivities. Being\r\nstill too young to go often to the theatre, and not rich enough to\r\nafford any great outlay for private performances, the girls put their\r\nwits to work, and--necessity being the mother of invention,--made\r\nwhatever they needed. Very clever were some of their\r\nproductions,--pasteboard guitars, antique lamps made of old-fashioned\r\nbutter-boats covered with silver paper, gorgeous robes of old cotton,\r\nglittering with tin spangles from a pickle factory, and armor covered\r\nwith the same useful diamond-shaped bits, left in sheets when the lids\r\nof tin preserve-pots were cut out. The furniture was used to being\r\nturned topsy-turvy, and the big chamber was the scene of many innocent\r\nrevels.\r\n\r\nNo gentlemen were admitted; so Jo played male parts to her heart's\r\ncontent, and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet-leather boots\r\ngiven her by a friend, who knew a lady who knew an actor. These boots,\r\nan old foil, and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some\r\npicture, were Jo's chief treasures, and appeared on all occasions. The\r\nsmallness of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors\r\nto take several parts apiece; and they certainly deserved some credit\r\nfor the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts,\r\nwhisking in and out of various costumes, and managing the stage besides.\r\nIt was excellent drill for their memories, a harmless amusement, and\r\nemployed many hours which otherwise would have been idle, lonely, or\r\nspent in less profitable society.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas night, a dozen girls piled on to the bed which was the\r\ndress-circle, and sat before the blue and yellow chintz curtains in a\r\nmost flattering state of expectancy. There was a good deal of rustling\r\nand whispering behind the curtain, a trifle of lamp-smoke, and an\r\noccasional giggle from Amy, who was apt to get hysterical in the\r\nexcitement of the moment. Presently a bell sounded, the curtains flew\r\napart, and the Operatic Tragedy began.\r\n\r\n\"A gloomy wood,\" according to the one play-bill, was represented by a\r\nfew shrubs in pots, green baize on the floor, and a cave in the\r\ndistance. This cave was made with a clothes-horse for a roof, bureaus\r\nfor walls; and in it was a small furnace in full blast, with a black pot\r\non it, and an old witch bending over it. The stage was dark, and the\r\nglow of the furnace had a fine effect, especially as real steam issued\r\nfrom the kettle when the witch took off the cover. A moment was allowed\r\nfor the first thrill to subside; then Hugo, the villain, stalked in with\r\na clanking sword at his side, a slouched hat, black beard, mysterious\r\ncloak, and the boots. After pacing to and fro in much agitation, he\r\nstruck his forehead, and burst out in a wild strain, singing of his\r\nhatred to Roderigo, his love for Zara, and his pleasing resolution to\r\nkill the one and win the other. The gruff tones of Hugo's voice, with an\r\noccasional shout when his feelings overcame him, were very impressive,\r\nand the audience applauded the moment he paused for breath. Bowing with\r\nthe air of one accustomed to public praise, he stole to the cavern, and\r\nordered Hagar to come forth with a commanding \"What ho, minion! I need\r\nthee!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Out came Meg with gray horse-hair hanging about her face]\r\n\r\nOut came Meg, with gray horse-hair hanging about her face, a red and\r\nblack robe, a staff, and cabalistic signs upon her cloak. Hugo demanded\r\na potion to make Zara adore him, and one to destroy Roderigo. Hagar, in\r\na fine dramatic melody, promised both, and proceeded to call up the\r\nspirit who would bring the love philter:--\r\n\r\n        \"Hither, hither, from thy home,\r\n         Airy sprite, I bid thee come!\r\n         Born of roses, fed on dew,\r\n         Charms and potions canst thou brew?\r\n         Bring me here, with elfin speed,\r\n         The fragrant philter which I need;\r\n         Make it sweet and swift and strong,\r\n         Spirit, answer now my song!\"\r\n\r\n            [Illustration: A little figure in cloudy white]\r\n\r\nA soft strain of music sounded, and then at the back of the cave\r\nappeared a little figure in cloudy white, with glittering wings, golden\r\nhair, and a garland of roses on its head. Waving a wand, it sang,--\r\n\r\n         \"Hither I come,\r\n          From my airy home,\r\n        Afar in the silver moon.\r\n          Take the magic spell,\r\n          And use it well,\r\n        Or its power will vanish soon!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, dropping a small, gilded bottle at the witch's feet, the spirit\r\nvanished. Another chant from Hagar produced another apparition,--not a\r\nlovely one; for, with a bang, an ugly black imp appeared, and, having\r\ncroaked a reply, tossed a dark bottle at Hugo, and disappeared with a\r\nmocking laugh. Having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his\r\nboots, Hugo departed; and Hagar informed the audience that, as he had\r\nkilled a few of her friends in times past, she has cursed him, and\r\nintends to thwart his plans, and be revenged on him. Then the curtain\r\nfell, and the audience reposed and ate candy while discussing the merits\r\nof the play.\r\n\r\nA good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again; but when\r\nit became evident what a masterpiece of stage-carpentering had been got\r\nup, no one murmured at the delay. It was truly superb! A tower rose to\r\nthe ceiling; half-way up appeared a window, with a lamp burning at it,\r\nand behind the white curtain appeared Zara in a lovely blue and silver\r\ndress, waiting for Roderigo. He came in gorgeous array, with plumed cap,\r\nred cloak, chestnut love-locks, a guitar, and the boots, of course.\r\nKneeling at the foot of the tower, he sang a serenade in melting tones.\r\nZara replied, and, after a musical dialogue, consented to fly. Then came\r\nthe grand effect of the play. Roderigo produced a rope-ladder, with five\r\nsteps to it, threw up one end, and invited Zara to descend. Timidly she\r\ncrept from her lattice, put her hand on Roderigo's shoulder, and was\r\nabout to leap gracefully down, when, \"Alas! alas for Zara!\" she forgot\r\nher train,--it caught in the window; the tower tottered, leaned forward,\r\nfell with a crash, and buried the unhappy lovers in the ruins!\r\n\r\nA universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from the\r\nwreck, and a golden head emerged, exclaiming, \"I told you so! I told you\r\nso!\" With wonderful presence of mind, Don Pedro, the cruel sire, rushed\r\nin, dragged out his daughter, with a hasty aside,--\r\n\r\n\"Don't laugh! Act as if it was all right!\"--and, ordering Roderigo up,\r\nbanished him from the kingdom with wrath and scorn. Though decidedly\r\nshaken by the fall of the tower upon him, Roderigo defied the old\r\ngentleman, and refused to stir. This dauntless example fired Zara: she\r\nalso defied her sire, and he ordered them both to the deepest dungeons\r\nof the castle. A stout little retainer came in with chains, and led them\r\naway, looking very much frightened, and evidently forgetting the speech\r\nhe ought to have made.\r\n\r\nAct third was the castle hall; and here Hagar appeared, having come to\r\nfree the lovers and finish Hugo. She hears him coming, and hides; sees\r\nhim put the potions into two cups of wine, and bid the timid little\r\nservant \"Bear them to the captives in their cells, and tell them I shall\r\ncome anon.\" The servant takes Hugo aside to tell him something, and\r\nHagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless. Ferdinando,\r\nthe \"minion,\" carries them away, and Hagar puts back the cup which holds\r\nthe poison meant for Roderigo. Hugo, getting thirsty after a long\r\nwarble, drinks it, loses his wits, and, after a good deal of clutching\r\nand stamping, falls flat and dies; while Hagar informs him what she has\r\ndone in a song of exquisite power and melody.\r\n\r\nThis was a truly thrilling scene, though some persons might have thought\r\nthat the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long hair rather marred\r\nthe effect of the villain's death. He was called before the curtain, and\r\nwith great propriety appeared, leading Hagar, whose singing was\r\nconsidered more wonderful than all the rest of the performance put\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nAct fourth displayed the despairing Roderigo on the point of stabbing\r\nhimself, because he has been told that Zara has deserted him. Just as\r\nthe dagger is at his heart, a lovely song is sung under his window,\r\ninforming him that Zara is true, but in danger, and he can save her, if\r\nhe will. A key is thrown in, which unlocks the door, and in a spasm of\r\nrapture he tears off his chains, and rushes away to find and rescue his\r\nlady-love.\r\n\r\nAct fifth opened with a stormy scene between Zara and Don Pedro. He\r\nwishes her to go into a convent, but she won't hear of it; and, after a\r\ntouching appeal, is about to faint, when Roderigo dashes in and demands\r\nher hand. Don Pedro refuses, because he is not rich. They shout and\r\ngesticulate tremendously, but cannot agree, and Roderigo is about to\r\nbear away the exhausted Zara, when the timid servant enters with a\r\nletter and a bag from Hagar, who has mysteriously disappeared. The\r\nlatter informs the party that she bequeaths untold wealth to the young\r\npair, and an awful doom to Don Pedro, if he doesn't make them happy. The\r\nbag is opened, and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the\r\nstage, till it is quite glorified with the glitter. This entirely\r\nsoftens the \"stern sire\": he consents without a murmur, all join in a\r\njoyful chorus, and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive\r\nDon Pedro's blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: The lovers kneeling to receive Don Pedro's blessing]\r\n\r\nTumultuous applause followed, but received an unexpected check; for the\r\ncot-bed, on which the \"dress-circle\" was built, suddenly shut up, and\r\nextinguished the enthusiastic audience. Roderigo and Don Pedro flew to\r\nthe rescue, and all were taken out unhurt, though many were speechless\r\nwith laughter. The excitement had hardly subsided, when Hannah appeared,\r\nwith \"Mrs. March's compliments, and would the ladies walk down to\r\nsupper.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a surprise, even to the actors; and, when they saw the table,\r\nthey looked at one another in rapturous amazement. It was like Marmee to\r\nget up a little treat for them; but anything so fine as this was\r\nunheard-of since the departed days of plenty. There was\r\nice-cream,--actually two dishes of it, pink and white,--and cake and\r\nfruit and distracting French bonbons, and, in the middle of the table,\r\nfour great bouquets of hot-house flowers!\r\n\r\nIt quite took their breath away; and they stared first at the table and\r\nthen at their mother, who looked as if she enjoyed it immensely.\r\n\r\n\"Is it fairies?\" asked Amy,\r\n\r\n\"It's Santa Claus,\" said Beth.\r\n\r\n\"Mother did it\"; and Meg smiled her sweetest, in spite of her gray beard\r\nand white eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\"Aunt March had a good fit, and sent the supper,\" cried Jo, with a\r\nsudden inspiration.\r\n\r\n\"All wrong. Old Mr. Laurence sent it,\" replied Mrs. March.\r\n\r\n\"The Laurence boy's grandfather! What in the world put such a thing into\r\nhis head? We don't know him!\" exclaimed Meg.\r\n\r\n\"Hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party. He is an\r\nodd old gentleman, but that pleased him. He knew my father, years ago;\r\nand he sent me a polite note this afternoon, saying he hoped I would\r\nallow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children by sending\r\nthem a few trifles in honor of the day. I could not refuse; and so you\r\nhave a little feast at night to make up for the bread-and-milk\r\nbreakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"That boy put it into his head, I know he did! He's a capital fellow,\r\nand I wish we could get acquainted. He looks as if he'd like to know us;\r\nbut he's bashful, and Meg is so prim she won't let me speak to him when\r\nwe pass,\" said Jo, as the plates went round, and the ice began to melt\r\nout of sight, with \"Ohs!\" and \"Ahs!\" of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"You mean the people who live in the big house next door, don't you?\"\r\nasked one of the girls. \"My mother knows old Mr. Laurence; but says he's\r\nvery proud, and doesn't like to mix with his neighbors. He keeps his\r\ngrandson shut up, when he isn't riding or walking with his tutor, and\r\nmakes him study very hard. We invited him to our party, but he didn't\r\ncome. Mother says he's very nice, though he never speaks to us girls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our cat ran away once, and he brought her back, and we talked over the\r\nfence, and were getting on capitally,--all about cricket, and so\r\non,--when he saw Meg coming, and walked off. I mean to know him some\r\nday; for he needs fun, I'm sure he does,\" said Jo decidedly.\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: We talked over the fence]\r\n\r\n\"I like his manners, and he looks like a little gentleman; so I've no\r\nobjection to your knowing him, if a proper opportunity comes. He brought\r\nthe flowers himself; and I should have asked him in, if I had been sure\r\nwhat was going on upstairs. He looked so wistful as he went away,\r\nhearing the frolic, and evidently having none of his own.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a mercy you didn't, mother!\" laughed Jo, looking at her boots.\r\n\"But we'll have another play, some time, that he _can_ see. Perhaps\r\nhe'll help act; wouldn't that be jolly?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never had such a fine bouquet before! How pretty it is!\" And Meg\r\nexamined her flowers with great interest.\r\n\r\n\"They _are_ lovely! But Beth's roses are sweeter to me,\" said Mrs.\r\nMarch, smelling the half-dead posy in her belt.\r\n\r\nBeth nestled up to her, and whispered softly, \"I wish I could send my\r\nbunch to father. I'm afraid he isn't having such a merry Christmas as we\r\nare.\"\r\n\r\n                       [Illustration: Tail-piece]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Eating apples and crying over the \"Heir of Redclyffe\"]\r\n\r\n                                  III.\r\n\r\n                           THE LAURENCE BOY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Jo! Jo! where are you?\" cried Meg, at the foot of the garret stairs.\r\n\r\n\"Here!\" answered a husky voice from above; and, running up, Meg found\r\nher sister eating apples and crying over the \"Heir of Redclyffe,\"\r\nwrapped up in a comforter on an old three-legged sofa by the sunny\r\nwindow. This was Jo's favorite refuge; and here she loved to retire with\r\nhalf a dozen russets and a nice book, to enjoy the quiet and the society\r\nof a pet rat who lived near by, and didn't mind her a particle. As Meg\r\nappeared, Scrabble whisked into his hole. Jo shook the tears off her\r\ncheeks, and waited to hear the news.\r\n\r\n\"Such fun! only see! a regular note of invitation from Mrs. Gardiner for\r\nto-morrow night!\" cried Meg, waving the precious paper, and then\r\nproceeding to read it, with girlish delight.\r\n\r\n\"'Mrs. Gardiner would be happy to see Miss March and Miss Josephine at a\r\nlittle dance on New-Year's Eve.' Marmee is willing we should go; now\r\nwhat _shall_ we wear?\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the use of asking that, when you know we shall wear our poplins,\r\nbecause we haven't got anything else?\" answered Jo, with her mouth full.\r\n\r\n\"If I only had a silk!\" sighed Meg. \"Mother says I may when I'm\r\neighteen, perhaps; but two years is an everlasting time to wait.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure our pops look like silk, and they are nice enough for us.\r\nYours is as good as new, but I forgot the burn and the tear in mine.\r\nWhatever shall I do? the burn shows badly, and I can't take any out.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must sit still all you can, and keep your back out of sight; the\r\nfront is all right. I shall have a new ribbon for my hair, and Marmee\r\nwill lend me her little pearl pin, and my new slippers are lovely, and\r\nmy gloves will do, though they aren't as nice as I'd like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mine are spoilt with lemonade, and I can't get any new ones, so I shall\r\nhave to go without,\" said Jo, who never troubled herself much about\r\ndress.\r\n\r\n\"You _must_ have gloves, or I won't go,\" cried Meg decidedly. \"Gloves\r\nare more important than anything else; you can't dance without them, and\r\nif you don't I should be _so_ mortified.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll stay still. I don't care much for company dancing; it's no\r\nfun to go sailing round; I like to fly about and cut capers.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't ask mother for new ones, they are so expensive, and you are\r\nso careless. She said, when you spoilt the others, that she shouldn't\r\nget you any more this winter. Can't you make them do?\" asked Meg\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n\"I can hold them crumpled up in my hand, so no one will know how stained\r\nthey are; that's all I can do. No! I'll tell you how we can manage--each\r\nwear one good one and carry a bad one; don't you see?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your hands are bigger than mine, and you will stretch my glove\r\ndreadfully,\" began Meg, whose gloves were a tender point with her.\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll go without. I don't care what people say!\" cried Jo, taking\r\nup her book.\r\n\r\n\"You may have it, you may! only don't stain it, and do behave nicely.\r\nDon't put your hands behind you, or stare, or say 'Christopher\r\nColumbus!' will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry about me; I'll be as prim as I can, and not get into any\r\nscrapes, if I can help it. Now go and answer your note, and let me\r\nfinish this splendid story.\"\r\n\r\nSo Meg went away to \"accept with thanks,\" look over her dress, and sing\r\nblithely as she did up her one real lace frill; while Jo finished her\r\nstory, her four apples, and had a game of romps with Scrabble.\r\n\r\nOn New-Year's Eve the parlor was deserted, for the two younger girls\r\nplayed dressing-maids, and the two elder were absorbed in the\r\nall-important business of \"getting ready for the party.\" Simple as the\r\ntoilets were, there was a great deal of running up and down, laughing\r\nand talking, and at one time a strong smell of burnt hair pervaded the\r\nhouse. Meg wanted a few curls about her face, and Jo undertook to pinch\r\nthe papered locks with a pair of hot tongs.\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: Jo undertook to pinch the papered locks]\r\n\r\n\"Ought they to smoke like that?\" asked Beth, from her perch on the bed.\r\n\r\n\"It's the dampness drying,\" replied Jo.\r\n\r\n\"What a queer smell! it's like burnt feathers,\" observed Amy, smoothing\r\nher own pretty curls with a superior air.\r\n\r\n\"There, now I'll take off the papers and you'll see a cloud of little\r\nringlets,\" said Jo, putting down the tongs.\r\n\r\nShe did take off the papers, but no cloud of ringlets appeared, for the\r\nhair came with the papers, and the horrified hair-dresser laid a row of\r\nlittle scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, oh, oh! what _have_ you done? I'm spoilt! I can't go! My hair, oh,\r\nmy hair!\" wailed Meg, looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on her\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n\"Just my luck! you shouldn't have asked me to do it; I always spoil\r\neverything. I'm so sorry, but the tongs were too hot, and so I've made a\r\nmess,\" groaned poor Jo, regarding the black pancakes with tears of\r\nregret.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't spoilt; just frizzle it, and tie your ribbon so the ends come\r\non your forehead a bit, and it will look like the last fashion. I've\r\nseen many girls do it so,\" said Amy consolingly.\r\n\r\n\"Serves me right for trying to be fine. I wish I'd let my hair alone,\"\r\ncried Meg petulantly.\r\n\r\n\"So do I, it was so smooth and pretty. But it will soon grow out again,\"\r\nsaid Beth, coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep.\r\n\r\nAfter various lesser mishaps, Meg was finished at last, and by the\r\nunited exertions of the family Jo's hair was got up and her dress on.\r\nThey looked very well in their simple suits,--Meg in silvery drab, with\r\na blue velvet snood, lace frills, and the pearl pin; Jo in maroon, with\r\na stiff, gentlemanly linen collar, and a white chrysanthemum or two for\r\nher only ornament. Each put on one nice light glove, and carried one\r\nsoiled one, and all pronounced the effect \"quite easy and fine.\" Meg's\r\nhigh-heeled slippers were very tight, and hurt her, though she would not\r\nown it, and Jo's nineteen hair-pins all seemed stuck straight into her\r\nhead, which was not exactly comfortable; but, dear me, let us be elegant\r\nor die!\r\n\r\n\"Have a good time, dearies!\" said Mrs. March, as the sisters went\r\ndaintily down the walk. \"Don't eat much supper, and come away at eleven,\r\nwhen I send Hannah for you.\" As the gate clashed behind them, a voice\r\ncried from a window,--\r\n\r\n\"Girls, girls! _have_ you both got nice pocket-handkerchiefs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, spandy nice, and Meg has cologne on hers,\" cried Jo, adding,\r\nwith a laugh, as they went on, \"I do believe Marmee would ask that if we\r\nwere all running away from an earthquake.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is one of her aristocratic tastes, and quite proper, for a real lady\r\nis always known by neat boots, gloves, and handkerchief,\" replied Meg,\r\nwho had a good many little \"aristocratic tastes\" of her own.\r\n\r\n\"Now don't forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight, Jo. Is my sash\r\nright? and does my hair look _very_ bad?\" said Meg, as she turned from\r\nthe glass in Mrs. Gardiner's dressing-room, after a prolonged prink.\r\n\r\n\"I know I shall forget. If you see me doing anything wrong, just remind\r\nme by a wink, will you?\" returned Jo, giving her collar a twitch and her\r\nhead a hasty brush.\r\n\r\n\"No, winking isn't lady-like; I'll lift my eyebrows if anything is\r\nwrong, and nod if you are all right. Now hold your shoulders straight,\r\nand take short steps, and don't shake hands if you are introduced to any\r\none: it isn't the thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"How _do_ you learn all the proper ways? I never can. Isn't that music\r\ngay?\"\r\n\r\n             [Illustration: Mrs. Gardiner greeted them]\r\n\r\nDown they went, feeling a trifle timid, for they seldom went to parties,\r\nand, informal as this little gathering was, it was an event to them.\r\nMrs. Gardiner, a stately old lady, greeted them kindly, and handed them\r\nover to the eldest of her six daughters. Meg knew Sallie, and was at her\r\nease very soon; but Jo, who didn't care much for girls or girlish\r\ngossip, stood about, with her back carefully against the wall, and felt\r\nas much out of place as a colt in a flower-garden. Half a dozen jovial\r\nlads were talking about skates in another part of the room, and she\r\nlonged to go and join them, for skating was one of the joys of her life.\r\nShe telegraphed her wish to Meg, but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly\r\nthat she dared not stir. No one came to talk to her, and one by one the\r\ngroup near her dwindled away, till she was left alone. She could not\r\nroam about and amuse herself, for the burnt breadth would show, so she\r\nstared at people rather forlornly till the dancing began. Meg was asked\r\nat once, and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none would\r\nhave guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly. Jo saw a big\r\nred-headed youth approaching her corner, and fearing he meant to engage\r\nher, she slipped into a curtained recess, intending to peep and enjoy\r\nherself in peace. Unfortunately, another bashful person had chosen the\r\nsame refuge; for, as the curtain fell behind her, she found herself face\r\nto face with the \"Laurence boy.\"\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: Face to face with the Laurence boy]\r\n\r\n\"Dear me, I didn't know any one was here!\" stammered Jo, preparing to\r\nback out as speedily as she had bounced in.\r\n\r\nBut the boy laughed, and said pleasantly, though he looked a little\r\nstartled,--\r\n\r\n\"Don't mind me; stay, if you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sha'n't I disturb you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit; I only came here because I don't know many people, and felt\r\nrather strange at first, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"So did I. Don't go away, please, unless you'd rather.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy sat down again and looked at his pumps, till Jo said, trying to\r\nbe polite and easy,--\r\n\r\n\"I think I've had the pleasure of seeing you before; you live near us,\r\ndon't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Next door\"; and he looked up and laughed outright, for Jo's prim manner\r\nwas rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about cricket\r\nwhen he brought the cat home.\r\n\r\nThat put Jo at her ease; and she laughed too, as she said, in her\r\nheartiest way,--\r\n\r\n\"We did have such a good time over your nice Christmas present.\"\r\n\r\n\"Grandpa sent it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you put it into his head, didn't you, now?\"\r\n\r\n\"How is your cat, Miss March?\" asked the boy, trying to look sober,\r\nwhile his black eyes shone with fun.\r\n\r\n\"Nicely, thank you, Mr. Laurence; but I am not Miss March, I'm only Jo,\"\r\nreturned the young lady.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not Mr. Laurence, I'm only Laurie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Laurie Laurence,--what an odd name!\"\r\n\r\n\"My first name is Theodore, but I don't like it, for the fellows called\r\nme Dora, so I made them say Laurie instead.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hate my name, too--so sentimental! I wish every one would say Jo,\r\ninstead of Josephine. How did you make the boys stop calling you Dora?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thrashed 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't thrash Aunt March, so I suppose I shall have to bear it\"; and\r\nJo resigned herself with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you like to dance, Miss Jo?\" asked Laurie, looking as if he\r\nthought the name suited her.\r\n\r\n\"I like it well enough if there is plenty of room, and every one is\r\nlively. In a place like this I'm sure to upset something, tread on\r\npeople's toes, or do something dreadful, so I keep out of mischief, and\r\nlet Meg sail about. Don't you dance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes; you see I've been abroad a good many years, and haven't been\r\ninto company enough yet to know how you do things here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Abroad!\" cried Jo. \"Oh, tell me about it! I love dearly to hear people\r\ndescribe their travels.\"\r\n\r\nLaurie didn't seem to know where to begin; but Jo's eager questions soon\r\nset him going, and he told her how he had been at school in Vevay, where\r\nthe boys never wore hats, and had a fleet of boats on the lake, and for\r\nholiday fun went walking trips about Switzerland with their teachers.\r\n\r\n\"Don't I wish I'd been there!\" cried Jo. \"Did you go to Paris?\"\r\n\r\n\"We spent last winter there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you talk French?\"\r\n\r\n\"We were not allowed to speak any thing else at Vevay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do say some! I can read it, but can't pronounce.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quel nom a cette jeune demoiselle en les pantoufles jolis?\" said Laurie\r\ngood-naturedly.\r\n\r\n\"How nicely you do it! Let me see,--you said, 'Who is the young lady in\r\nthe pretty slippers,' didn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oui, mademoiselle.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's my sister Margaret, and you knew it was! Do you think she is\r\npretty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; she makes me think of the German girls, she looks so fresh and\r\nquiet, and dances like a lady.\"\r\n\r\nJo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister, and\r\nstored it up to repeat to Meg. Both peeped and criticised and chatted,\r\ntill they felt like old acquaintances. Laurie's bashfulness soon wore\r\noff; for Jo's gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease, and\r\nJo was her merry self again, because her dress was forgotten, and nobody\r\nlifted their eyebrows at her. She liked the \"Laurence boy\" better than\r\never, and took several good looks at him, so that she might describe him\r\nto the girls; for they had no brothers, very few male cousins, and boys\r\nwere almost unknown creatures to them.\r\n\r\n\"Curly black hair; brown skin; big, black eyes; handsome nose; fine\r\nteeth; small hands and feet; taller than I am; very polite, for a boy,\r\nand altogether jolly. Wonder how old he is?\"\r\n\r\nIt was on the tip of Jo's tongue to ask; but she checked herself in\r\ntime, and, with unusual tact, tried to find out in a roundabout way.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you are going to college soon? I see you pegging away at your\r\nbooks,--no, I mean studying hard\"; and Jo blushed at the dreadful\r\n\"pegging\" which had escaped her.\r\n\r\nLaurie smiled, but didn't seem shocked, and answered, with a shrug,--\r\n\r\n\"Not for a year or two; I won't go before seventeen, anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you but fifteen?\" asked Jo, looking at the tall lad, whom she\r\nhad imagined seventeen already.\r\n\r\n\"Sixteen, next month.\"\r\n\r\n\"How I wish I was going to college! You don't look as if you liked it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hate it! Nothing but grinding or skylarking. And I don't like the way\r\nfellows do either, in this country.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you like?\"\r\n\r\n\"To live in Italy, and to enjoy myself in my own way.\"\r\n\r\nJo wanted very much to ask what his own way was; but his black brows\r\nlooked rather threatening as he knit them; so she changed the subject by\r\nsaying, as her foot kept time, \"That's a splendid polka! Why don't you\r\ngo and try it?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you will come too,\" he answered, with a gallant little bow.\r\n\r\n\"I can't; for I told Meg I wouldn't, because--\" There Jo stopped, and\r\nlooked undecided whether to tell or to laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Because what?\" asked Laurie curiously.\r\n\r\n\"You won't tell?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I have a bad trick of standing before the fire, and so I burn my\r\nfrocks, and I scorched this one; and, though it's nicely mended, it\r\nshows, and Meg told me to keep still, so no one would see it. You may\r\nlaugh, if you want to; it is funny, I know.\"\r\n\r\nBut Laurie didn't laugh; he only looked down a minute, and the\r\nexpression of his face puzzled Jo, when he said very gently,--\r\n\r\n\"Never mind that; I'll tell you how we can manage: there's a long hall\r\nout there, and we can dance grandly, and no one will see us. Please\r\ncome?\"\r\n\r\nJo thanked him, and gladly went, wishing she had two neat gloves, when\r\nshe saw the nice, pearl-colored ones her partner wore. The hall was\r\nempty, and they had a grand polka; for Laurie danced well, and taught\r\nher the German step, which delighted Jo, being full of swing and spring.\r\nWhen the music stopped, they sat down on the stairs to get their breath;\r\nand Laurie was in the midst of an account of a students' festival at\r\nHeidelberg, when Meg appeared in search of her sister. She beckoned, and\r\nJo reluctantly followed her into a side-room, where she found her on a\r\nsofa, holding her foot, and looking pale.\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: They sat down on the stairs]\r\n\r\n\"I've sprained my ankle. That stupid high heel turned, and gave me a sad\r\nwrench. It aches so, I can hardly stand, and I don't know how I'm ever\r\ngoing to get home,\" she said, rocking to and fro in pain.\r\n\r\n\"I knew you'd hurt your feet with those silly shoes. I'm sorry. But I\r\ndon't see what you can do, except get a carriage, or stay here all\r\nnight,\" answered Jo, softly rubbing the poor ankle as she spoke.\r\n\r\n\"I can't have a carriage, without its costing ever so much. I dare say I\r\ncan't get one at all; for most people come in their own, and it's a long\r\nway to the stable, and no one to send.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed! It's past nine, and dark as Egypt. I can't stop here, for\r\nthe house is full. Sallie has some girls staying with her. I'll rest\r\ntill Hannah comes, and then do the best I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll ask Laurie; he will go,\" said Jo, looking relieved as the idea\r\noccurred to her.\r\n\r\n\"Mercy, no! Don't ask or tell any one. Get me my rubbers, and put these\r\nslippers with our things. I can't dance any more; but as soon as supper\r\nis over, watch for Hannah, and tell me the minute she comes.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are going out to supper now. I'll stay with you; I'd rather.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, dear, run along, and bring me some coffee. I'm so tired, I can't\r\nstir!\"\r\n\r\nSo Meg reclined, with rubbers well hidden, and Jo went blundering away\r\nto the dining-room, which she found after going into a china-closet, and\r\nopening the door of a room where old Mr. Gardiner was taking a little\r\nprivate refreshment. Making a dart at the table, she secured the coffee,\r\nwhich she immediately spilt, thereby making the front of her dress as\r\nbad as the back.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear, what a blunderbuss I am!\" exclaimed Jo, finishing Meg's glove\r\nby scrubbing her gown with it.\r\n\r\n\"Can I help you?\" said a friendly voice; and there was Laurie, with a\r\nfull cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other.\r\n\r\n\"I was trying to get something for Meg, who is very tired, and some one\r\nshook me; and here I am, in a nice state,\" answered Jo, glancing\r\ndismally from the stained skirt to the coffee-colored glove.\r\n\r\n\"Too bad! I was looking for some one to give this to. May I take it to\r\nyour sister?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, thank you! I'll show you where she is. I don't offer to take it\r\nmyself, for I should only get into another scrape if I did.\"\r\n\r\nJo led the way; and, as if used to waiting on ladies, Laurie drew up a\r\nlittle table, brought a second instalment of coffee and ice for Jo, and\r\nwas so obliging that even particular Meg pronounced him a \"nice boy.\"\r\nThey had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes, and were in the\r\nmidst of a quiet game of \"Buzz,\" with two or three other young people\r\nwho had strayed in, when Hannah appeared. Meg forgot her foot, and rose\r\nso quickly that she was forced to catch hold of Jo, with an exclamation\r\nof pain.\r\n\r\n\"Hush! Don't say anything,\" she whispered, adding aloud, \"It's nothing.\r\nI turned my foot a little, that's all\"; and limped up-stairs to put her\r\nthings on.\r\n\r\nHannah scolded, Meg cried, and Jo was at her wits' end, till she\r\ndecided to take things into her own hands. Slipping out, she ran down,\r\nand, finding a servant, asked if he could get her a carriage. It\r\nhappened to be a hired waiter, who knew nothing about the neighborhood;\r\nand Jo was looking round for help, when Laurie, who had heard what she\r\nsaid, came up, and offered his grandfather's carriage, which had just\r\ncome for him, he said.\r\n\r\n\"It's so early! You can't mean to go yet?\" began Jo, looking relieved,\r\nbut hesitating to accept the offer.\r\n\r\n\"I always go early,--I do, truly! Please let me take you home? It's all\r\non my way, you know, and it rains, they say.\"\r\n\r\nThat settled it; and, telling him of Meg's mishap, Jo gratefully\r\naccepted, and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party. Hannah\r\nhated rain as much as a cat does; so she made no trouble, and they\r\nrolled away in the luxurious close carriage, feeling very festive and\r\nelegant. Laurie went on the box; so Meg could keep her foot up, and the\r\ngirls talked over their party in freedom.\r\n\r\n\"I had a capital time. Did you?\" asked Jo, rumpling up her hair, and\r\nmaking herself comfortable.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, till I hurt myself. Sallie's friend, Annie Moffat, took a fancy to\r\nme, and asked me to come and spend a week with her, when Sallie does.\r\nShe is going in the spring, when the opera comes; and it will be\r\nperfectly splendid, if mother only lets me go,\" answered Meg, cheering\r\nup at the thought.\r\n\r\n\"I saw you dancing with the red-headed man I ran away from. Was he\r\nnice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, very! His hair is auburn, not red; and he was very polite, and I\r\nhad a delicious redowa with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He looked like a grasshopper in a fit, when he did the new step. Laurie\r\nand I couldn't help laughing. Did you hear us?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but it was very rude. What _were_ you about all that time, hidden\r\naway there?\"\r\n\r\nJo told her adventures, and, by the time she had finished, they were at\r\nhome. With many thanks, they said \"Good night,\" and crept in, hoping to\r\ndisturb no one; but the instant their door creaked, two little\r\nnight-caps bobbed up, and two sleepy but eager voices cried out,--\r\n\r\n\"Tell about the party! tell about the party!\"\r\n\r\nWith what Meg called \"a great want of manners,\" Jo had saved some\r\nbonbons for the little girls; and they soon subsided, after hearing the\r\nmost thrilling events of the evening.\r\n\r\n\"I declare, it really seems like being a fine young lady, to come home\r\nfrom the party in a carriage, and sit in my dressing-gown, with a maid\r\nto wait on me,\" said Meg, as Jo bound up her foot with arnica, and\r\nbrushed her hair.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we\r\ndo, in spite of our burnt hair, old gowns, one glove apiece, and tight\r\nslippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to wear them.\"\r\nAnd I think Jo was quite right.\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: Tell about the party]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: The kitten stuck like a burr just out of reach]\r\n\r\n                                  IV.\r\n\r\n                                BURDENS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Oh dear, how hard it does seem to take up our packs and go on,\" sighed\r\nMeg, the morning after the party; for, now the holidays were over, the\r\nweek of merry-making did not fit her for going on easily with the task\r\nshe never liked.\r\n\r\n\"I wish it was Christmas or New-Year all the time; wouldn't it be fun?\"\r\nanswered Jo, yawning dismally.\r\n\r\n\"We shouldn't enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now. But it does\r\nseem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets, and go to parties, and\r\ndrive home, and read and rest, and not work. It's like other people,\r\nyou know, and I always envy girls who do such things; I'm so fond of\r\nluxury,\" said Meg, trying to decide which of two shabby gowns was the\r\nleast shabby.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we can't have it, so don't let us grumble, but shoulder our\r\nbundles and trudge along as cheerfully as Marmee does. I'm sure Aunt\r\nMarch is a regular Old Man of the Sea to me, but I suppose when I've\r\nlearned to carry her without complaining, she will tumble off, or get so\r\nlight that I sha'n't mind her.\"\r\n\r\nThis idea tickled Jo's fancy, and put her in good spirits; but Meg\r\ndidn't brighten, for her burden, consisting of four spoilt children,\r\nseemed heavier than ever. She hadn't heart enough even to make herself\r\npretty, as usual, by putting on a blue neck-ribbon, and dressing her\r\nhair in the most becoming way.\r\n\r\n\"Where's the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those cross\r\nmidgets, and no one cares whether I'm pretty or not?\" she muttered,\r\nshutting her drawer with a jerk. \"I shall have to toil and moil all my\r\ndays, with only little bits of fun now and then, and get old and ugly\r\nand sour, because I'm poor, and can't enjoy my life as other girls do.\r\nIt's a shame!\"\r\n\r\nSo Meg went down, wearing an injured look, and wasn't at all agreeable\r\nat breakfast-time. Every one seemed rather out of sorts, and inclined to\r\ncroak. Beth had a headache, and lay on the sofa, trying to comfort\r\nherself with the cat and three kittens; Amy was fretting because her\r\nlessons were not learned, and she couldn't find her rubbers; Jo _would_\r\nwhistle and make a great racket getting ready; Mrs. March was very busy\r\ntrying to finish a letter, which must go at once; and Hannah had the\r\ngrumps, for being up late didn't suit her.\r\n\r\n\"There never _was_ such a cross family!\" cried Jo, losing her temper\r\nwhen she had upset an inkstand, broken both boot-lacings, and sat down\r\nupon her hat.\r\n\r\n\"You're the crossest person in it!\" returned Amy, washing out the sum,\r\nthat was all wrong, with the tears that had fallen on her slate.\r\n\r\n\"Beth, if you don't keep these horrid cats down cellar I'll have them\r\ndrowned,\" exclaimed Meg angrily, as she tried to get rid of the kitten,\r\nwhich had scrambled up her back, and stuck like a burr just out of\r\nreach.\r\n\r\nJo laughed, Meg scolded, Beth implored, and Amy wailed, because she\r\ncouldn't remember how much nine times twelve was.\r\n\r\n\"Girls, girls, do be quiet one minute! I _must_ get this off by the\r\nearly mail, and you drive me distracted with your worry,\" cried Mrs.\r\nMarch, crossing out the third spoilt sentence in her letter.\r\n\r\nThere was a momentary lull, broken by Hannah, who stalked in, laid two\r\nhot turn-overs on the table, and stalked out again. These turn-overs\r\nwere an institution; and the girls called them \"muffs,\" for they had no\r\nothers, and found the hot pies very comforting to their hands on cold\r\nmornings. Hannah never forgot to make them, no matter how busy or grumpy\r\nshe might be, for the walk was long and bleak; the poor things got no\r\nother lunch, and were seldom home before two.\r\n\r\n\"Cuddle your cats, and get over your headache, Bethy. Good-by, Marmee;\r\nwe are a set of rascals this morning, but we'll come home regular\r\nangels. Now then, Meg!\" and Jo tramped away, feeling that the pilgrims\r\nwere not setting out as they ought to do.\r\n\r\nThey always looked back before turning the corner, for their mother was\r\nalways at the window, to nod and smile, and wave her hand to them.\r\nSomehow it seemed as if they couldn't have got through the day without\r\nthat; for, whatever their mood might be, the last glimpse of that\r\nmotherly face was sure to affect them like sunshine.\r\n\r\n\"If Marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us, it would\r\nserve us right, for more ungrateful wretches than we are were never\r\nseen,\" cried Jo, taking a remorseful satisfaction in the snowy walk and\r\nbitter wind.\r\n\r\n\"Don't use such dreadful expressions,\" said Meg, from the depths of the\r\nvail in which she had shrouded herself like a nun sick of the world.\r\n\r\n\"I like good strong words, that mean something,\" replied Jo, catching\r\nher hat as it took a leap off her head, preparatory to flying away\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n\"Call yourself any names you like; but _I_ am neither a rascal nor a\r\nwretch, and I don't choose to be called so.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a blighted being, and decidedly cross to-day because you can't\r\nsit in the lap of luxury all the time. Poor dear, just wait till I make\r\nmy fortune, and you shall revel in carriages and ice-cream and\r\nhigh-heeled slippers and posies and red-headed boys to dance with.\"\r\n\r\n\"How ridiculous you are, Jo!\" but Meg laughed at the nonsense, and felt\r\nbetter in spite of herself.\r\n\r\n\"Lucky for you I am; for if I put on crushed airs, and tried to be\r\ndismal, as you do, we should be in a nice state. Thank goodness, I can\r\nalways find something funny to keep me up. Don't croak any more, but\r\ncome home jolly, there's a dear.\"\r\n\r\nJo gave her sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder as they parted for\r\nthe day, each going a different way, each hugging her little warm\r\nturn-over, and each trying to be cheerful in spite of wintry weather,\r\nhard work, and the unsatisfied desires of pleasure-loving youth.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. March lost his property in trying to help an unfortunate\r\nfriend, the two oldest girls begged to be allowed to do something toward\r\ntheir own support, at least. Believing that they could not begin too\r\nearly to cultivate energy, industry, and independence, their parents\r\nconsented, and both fell to work with the hearty good-will which in\r\nspite of all obstacles, is sure to succeed at last. Margaret found a\r\nplace as nursery governess, and felt rich with her small salary. As she\r\nsaid, she _was_ \"fond of luxury,\" and her chief trouble was poverty. She\r\nfound it harder to bear than the others, because she could remember a\r\ntime when home was beautiful, life full of ease and pleasure, and want\r\nof any kind unknown. She tried not to be envious or discontented, but it\r\nwas very natural that the young girl should long for pretty things, gay\r\nfriends, accomplishments, and a happy life. At the Kings' she daily saw\r\nall she wanted, for the children's older sisters were just out, and Meg\r\ncaught frequent glimpses of dainty ball-dresses and bouquets, heard\r\nlively gossip about theatres, concerts, sleighing parties, and\r\nmerry-makings of all kinds, and saw money lavished on trifles which\r\nwould have been so precious to her. Poor Meg seldom complained, but a\r\nsense of injustice made her feel bitter toward every one sometimes, for\r\nshe had not yet learned to know how rich she was in the blessings which\r\nalone can make life happy.\r\n\r\nJo happened to suit Aunt March, who was lame, and needed an active\r\nperson to wait upon her. The childless old lady had offered to adopt one\r\nof the girls when the troubles came, and was much offended because her\r\noffer was declined. Other friends told the Marches that they had lost\r\nall chance of being remembered in the rich old lady's will; but the\r\nunworldly Marches only said,--\r\n\r\n\"We can't give up our girls for a dozen fortunes. Rich or poor, we will\r\nkeep together and be happy in one another.\"\r\n\r\nThe old lady wouldn't speak to them for a time, but happening to meet Jo\r\nat a friend's, something in her comical face and blunt manners struck\r\nthe old lady's fancy, and she proposed to take her for a companion. This\r\ndid not suit Jo at all; but she accepted the place since nothing better\r\nappeared, and, to every one's surprise, got on remarkably well with her\r\nirascible relative. There was an occasional tempest, and once Jo had\r\nmarched home, declaring she couldn't bear it any longer; but Aunt March\r\nalways cleared up quickly, and sent for her back again with such urgency\r\nthat she could not refuse, for in her heart she rather liked the peppery\r\nold lady.\r\n\r\nI suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine books,\r\nwhich was left to dust and spiders since Uncle March died. Jo remembered\r\nthe kind old gentleman, who used to let her build railroads and bridges\r\nwith his big dictionaries, tell her stories about the queer pictures in\r\nhis Latin books, and buy her cards of gingerbread whenever he met her in\r\nthe street. The dim, dusty room, with the busts staring down from the\r\ntall book-cases, the cosy chairs, the globes, and, best of all, the\r\nwilderness of books, in which she could wander where she liked, made the\r\nlibrary a region of bliss to her. The moment Aunt March took her nap, or\r\nwas busy with company, Jo hurried to this quiet place, and, curling\r\nherself up in the easy-chair, devoured poetry, romance, history,\r\ntravels, and pictures, like a regular book-worm. But, like all\r\nhappiness, it did not last long; for as sure as she had just reached the\r\nheart of the story, the sweetest verse of the song, or the most perilous\r\nadventure of her traveller, a shrill voice called, \"Josy-phine!\r\nJosy-phine!\" and she had to leave her paradise to wind yarn, wash the\r\npoodle, or read Belsham's Essays by the hour together.\r\n\r\n          [Illustration: Curling herself up in the big chair]\r\n\r\nJo's ambition was to do something very splendid; what it was she had no\r\nidea, as yet, but left it for time to tell her; and, meanwhile, found\r\nher greatest affliction in the fact that she couldn't read, run, and\r\nride as much as she liked. A quick temper, sharp tongue, and restless\r\nspirit were always getting her into scrapes, and her life was a series\r\nof ups and downs, which were both comic and pathetic. But the training\r\nshe received at Aunt March's was just what she needed; and the thought\r\nthat she was doing something to support herself made her happy, in spite\r\nof the perpetual \"Josy-phine!\"\r\n\r\nBeth was too bashful to go to school; it had been tried, but she\r\nsuffered so much that it was given up, and she did her lessons at home,\r\nwith her father. Even when he went away, and her mother was called to\r\ndevote her skill and energy to Soldiers' Aid Societies, Beth went\r\nfaithfully on by herself, and did the best she could. She was a\r\nhousewifely little creature, and helped Hannah keep home neat and\r\ncomfortable for the workers, never thinking of any reward but to be\r\nloved. Long, quiet days she spent, not lonely nor idle, for her little\r\nworld was peopled with imaginary friends, and she was by nature a busy\r\nbee. There were six dolls to be taken up and dressed every morning, for\r\nBeth was a child still, and loved her pets as well as ever. Not one\r\nwhole or handsome one among them; all were outcasts till Beth took them\r\nin; for, when her sisters outgrew these idols, they passed to her,\r\nbecause Amy would have nothing old or ugly. Beth cherished them all the\r\nmore tenderly for that very reason, and set up a hospital for infirm\r\ndolls. No pins were ever stuck into their cotton vitals; no harsh words\r\nor blows were ever given them; no neglect ever saddened the heart of the\r\nmost repulsive: but all were fed and clothed, nursed and caressed, with\r\nan affection which never failed. One forlorn fragment of _dollanity_ had\r\nbelonged to Jo; and, having led a tempestuous life, was left a wreck in\r\nthe rag-bag, from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued by Beth, and\r\ntaken to her refuge. Having no top to its head, she tied on a neat\r\nlittle cap, and, as both arms and legs were gone, she hid these\r\ndeficiencies by folding it in a blanket, and devoting her best bed to\r\nthis chronic invalid. If any one had known the care lavished on that\r\ndolly, I think it would have touched their hearts, even while they\r\nlaughed. She brought it bits of bouquets; she read to it, took it out to\r\nbreathe the air, hidden under her coat; she sung it lullabys, and never\r\nwent to bed without kissing its dirty face, and whispering tenderly, \"I\r\nhope you'll have a good night, my poor dear.\"\r\n\r\nBeth had her troubles as well as the others; and not being an angel, but\r\na very human little girl, she often \"wept a little weep,\" as Jo said,\r\nbecause she couldn't take music lessons and have a fine piano. She loved\r\nmusic so dearly, tried so hard to learn, and practised away so patiently\r\nat the jingling old instrument, that it did seem as if some one (not to\r\nhint Aunt March) ought to help her. Nobody did, however, and nobody saw\r\nBeth wipe the tears off the yellow keys, that wouldn't keep in tune,\r\nwhen she was all alone. She sang like a little lark about her work,\r\nnever was too tired to play for Marmee and the girls, and day after day\r\nsaid hopefully to herself, \"I know I'll get my music some time, if I'm\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\nThere are many Beths in the world, shy and quiet, sitting in corners\r\ntill needed, and living for others so cheerfully that no one sees the\r\nsacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops chirping, and the\r\nsweet, sunshiny presence vanishes, leaving silence and shadow behind.\r\n\r\nIf anybody had asked Amy what the greatest trial of her life was, she\r\nwould have answered at once, \"My nose.\" When she was a baby, Jo had\r\naccidentally dropped her into the coal-hod, and Amy insisted that the\r\nfall had ruined her nose forever. It was not big, nor red, like poor\r\n\"Petrea's\"; it was only rather flat, and all the pinching in the world\r\ncould not give it an aristocratic point. No one minded it but herself,\r\nand it was doing its best to grow, but Amy felt deeply the want of a\r\nGrecian nose, and drew whole sheets of handsome ones to console herself.\r\n\r\n\"Little Raphael,\" as her sisters called her, had a decided talent for\r\ndrawing, and was never so happy as when copying flowers, designing\r\nfairies, or illustrating stories with queer specimens of art. Her\r\nteachers complained that, instead of doing her sums, she covered her\r\nslate with animals; the blank pages of her atlas were used to copy maps\r\non; and caricatures of the most ludicrous description came fluttering\r\nout of all her books at unlucky moments. She got through her lessons as\r\nwell as she could, and managed to escape reprimands by being a model of\r\ndeportment. She was a great favorite with her mates, being\r\ngood-tempered, and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort.\r\nHer little airs and graces were much admired, so were her\r\naccomplishments; for beside her drawing, she could play twelve tunes,\r\ncrochet, and read French without mispronouncing more than two thirds of\r\nthe words. She had a plaintive way of saying, \"When papa was rich we did\r\nso-and-so,\" which was very touching; and her long words were considered\r\n\"perfectly elegant\" by the girls.\r\n\r\nAmy was in a fair way to be spoilt; for every one petted her, and her\r\nsmall vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely. One thing,\r\nhowever, rather quenched the vanities; she had to wear her cousin's\r\nclothes. Now Florence's mamma hadn't a particle of taste, and Amy\r\nsuffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue bonnet,\r\nunbecoming gowns, and fussy aprons that did not fit. Everything was\r\ngood, well made, and little worn; but Amy's artistic eyes were much\r\nafflicted, especially this winter, when her school dress was a dull\r\npurple, with yellow dots, and no trimming.\r\n\r\n\"My only comfort,\" she said to Meg, with tears in her eyes, \"is, that\r\nmother don't take tucks in my dresses whenever I'm naughty, as Maria\r\nParks' mother does. My dear, it's really dreadful; for sometimes she is\r\nso bad, her frock is up to her knees, and she can't come to school. When\r\nI think of this _deggerredation_, I feel that I can bear even my flat\r\nnose and purple gown, with yellow sky-rockets on it.\"\r\n\r\nMeg was Amy's confidant and monitor, and, by some strange attraction of\r\nopposites, Jo was gentle Beth's. To Jo alone did the shy child tell her\r\nthoughts; and over her big, harum-scarum sister, Beth unconsciously\r\nexercised more influence than any one in the family. The two older girls\r\nwere a great deal to one another, but each took one of the younger into\r\nher keeping, and watched over her in her own way; \"playing mother\" they\r\ncalled it, and put their sisters in the places of discarded dolls, with\r\nthe maternal instinct of little women.\r\n\r\n\"Has anybody got anything to tell? It's been such a dismal day I'm\r\nreally dying for some amusement,\" said Meg, as they sat sewing together\r\nthat evening.\r\n\r\n\"I had a queer time with aunt to-day, and, as I got the best of it, I'll\r\ntell you about it,\" began Jo, who dearly loved to tell stories. \"I was\r\nreading that everlasting Belsham, and droning away as I always do, for\r\naunt soon drops off, and then I take out some nice book, and read like\r\nfury till she wakes up. I actually made myself sleepy; and, before she\r\nbegan to nod, I gave such a gape that she asked me what I meant by\r\nopening my mouth wide enough to take the whole book in at once.\r\n\r\n            [Illustration: Reading that everlasting Belsham]\r\n\r\n\"'I wish I could, and be done with it,' said I, trying not to be saucy.\r\n\r\n\"Then she gave me a long lecture on my sins, and told me to sit and\r\nthink them over while she just 'lost' herself for a moment. She never\r\nfinds herself very soon; so the minute her cap began to bob, like a\r\ntop-heavy dahlia, I whipped the 'Vicar of Wakefield' out of my pocket,\r\nand read away, with one eye on him, and one on aunt. I'd just got to\r\nwhere they all tumbled into the water, when I forgot, and laughed out\r\nloud. Aunt woke up; and, being more good-natured after her nap, told me\r\nto read a bit, and show what frivolous work I preferred to the worthy\r\nand instructive Belsham. I did my very best, and she liked it, though\r\nshe only said,--\r\n\r\n\"'I don't understand what it's all about. Go back and begin it, child.'\r\n\r\n\"Back I went, and made the Primroses as interesting as ever I could.\r\nOnce I was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place, and say meekly,\r\n'I'm afraid it tires you, ma'am; sha'n't I stop now?'\r\n\r\n\"She caught up her knitting, which had dropped out of her hands, gave me\r\na sharp look through her specs, and sai"
